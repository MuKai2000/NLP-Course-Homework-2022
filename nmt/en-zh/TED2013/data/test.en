that &apos;s another story .
it &apos;s an ocean planet , and we think of ourselves as a terrestrial species , but the pyramid of life in the ocean and our own lives on land are intricately connected .
I &apos;ll give you an example -- if you take a horse@@ shoe crab off the beach , and you fly it all the way across the continent , and you drop it into a slo@@ ped cage , it will scramble up the floor of the cage as the tide is rising on its home shores , and it &apos;ll sk@@ itter down again right as the water is receding thousands of miles away .
and it &apos;s incredible to watch , but there &apos;s nothing psychic or paranormal going on ; it &apos;s simply that these crabs have internal cycles that correspond , usually , with what &apos;s going on around it .
it &apos;s their kind of ur@@ -@@ story onstage , that desperation to live .
BJ : we had a big challenge with breathing .
and as I do that , I &apos;m not going to dwell much on the very large philanthropy that everybody already knows about -- the Gates or the Soros or the Google .
clay Shirky , that great chronic@@ ler of everything networked , has captured the assumption that this challenges in such a beautiful way .
and Judy saw her landscape being destroyed and her water poisoned .
and we changed strategy completely . I decided at the beginning -- it was a pretty good thing to decide in the beginning , it &apos;s not what we &apos;re doing now -- is to go to six countries .
and then we invited people all over the world to build them and experiment with us .
and there &apos;s a patent pending on these systems as well that &apos;s held by the community .
and that &apos;s one of the reasons they say a robot invasion is happening .
there was shared attention looking at the same sort of thing , and recognizing socially communicated rein@@ forcement at the end .
after all , that &apos;s certainly what modern molecular biology says about us .
people generally are comfortable with it , Democrats and Republicans .
I should also note that the &#91; discretionary &#93; spending , which is about 19 percent of the budget , that is Democratic and Republican issues , so you do have welfare , food stamps , other programs that tend to be popular among Democrats , but you also have the farm bill and all sorts of Department of Inter@@ ior induc@@ ements for oil drilling and other things , which tend to be popular among Republicans .
each of those times , we were on the verge of complete collapse .
I felt a sense of relaxation temper@@ ed with anticipation .
these are the bits , the pleasure centers , and maybe what I &apos;m seeing and sensing and feeling is bypassing my thinking .
no one &apos;s going to notice those split lines and changes .
this is pretty close to intrinsic beauty . this one , as long as you know what water is like then you can experience this .
it &apos;s a fantastic example , a simple object .
did you think it was modern ? yes you did .
I think we can one-@@ up the Greeks and achieve something .
but I don &apos;t know , reading things on a laptop -- whenever I pull up my laptop , it always feels like work .
this is just before he got kicked out by the Parks Services , for competing with the bookstore there .
so we actually got some funding from the World Bank to try it out .
but how do you go about doing all this scanning ?
so you basically do a beautiful , respectful job .
if we can get the 10 cents , all the rest of it flows .
we &apos;ve been archi@@ ving the World Wide Web since 1996 .
we take a snapshot of every website and all of the pages on it , every two months .
what &apos;s the role of the public versus the private as things go forward ?
I will take you first to an underground mine in Northern Minnesota where people are looking for something called dark matter .
the lake is entirely frozen .
because that phase of solid ice lasts for two months and it &apos;s full of cracks .
so , I hope to pier@@ ce that prejudice forever with this group .
the mushrooms then are harvested , but very importantly , the mycelium has converted the cellulose into fung@@ al sugars .
one of the Bi@@ osph@@ erians called it &quot; garden of Eden on top of an aircraft carrier . &quot;
we &apos;re not dead . we &apos;re fine . we &apos;re fine . &quot;
and we did indeed find it .
for two years I &apos;d been seeing people through the glass .
autonomy was our highest value .
this is not yet our norm in surgery -- let alone making checklists to go onto childbirth and other areas .
and these tend to be some of the most independent , tenacious , intuitive , you know , inventive people you will ever meet .
and if you &apos;re ever in Central Valley in February , you go to this caf@@ é at 10 o &apos;clock in the morning , Ka@@ thy and Kate &apos;s .
I mean , it &apos;s the most ethical swee@@ ten@@ er , and you know , it &apos;s a dynamic and fun swee@@ ten@@ er .
they &apos;re like tiny little flies and they fly around .
it used to be , two , three hundred years ago , that a lawn was a symbol of prestige , and so it was only the very rich that could keep these green actually , deserts : they &apos;re totally sterile .
why ?
they have computing power , they have electrical signals .
and these are three possibilities that we are working on to build hybrids , driven by algae or by the leaves at the end , by the most , most powerful parts of the plants , by the roots .
at TEDx@@ Rotterdam , world champion whist@@ ler Ge@@ ert Ch@@ atr@@ ou performs the whimsical &quot; Ele@@ on@@ ora &quot; by A. Hon@@ ho@@ ff , and his own &quot; F@@ ê@@ te de la Bel@@ le . &quot; in a fascinating inter@@ lude , he talks about what brought him to the craft .
that was great fun , of course .
and then we had dance so@@ los where only one person would dance and everybody would point to them .
and Past@@ or Rick was just talking about sheep .
I &apos;m going to talk about sheep , too .
if you understand Or@@ gel &apos;s Second Rule , then you understand why the Intelligent Design movement is basically a hoax .
we now wield the paintbrush . &quot;
the ant isn &apos;t alone .
it means &quot; surrender of self-interest to the will of Allah . &quot;
I &apos;m talking also about Christianity .
and you heard just now what the goal is .
you &apos;ve got a reasonable objection to it ?
a very clever little meme .
the Hindus say , &quot; N@@ ada bra@@ h@@ ma , &quot; one translation of which is , &quot; The world is sound . &quot;
there are all sorts of types of music that are very healthy .
I want to ask you all to consider for a second the very simple fact that , by far , most of what we know about the universe comes to us from light .
they &apos;re not brought to us with light , at least not directly .
but if we did a little thought experiment -- as Einstein was very fond of doing -- we could imagine putting the Sun crushed down to six kilometers , and putting a tiny little Earth around it in orbit , maybe 30 kilometers outside of the black-@@ hole sun .
it shows two black holes in orbit around each other , again , with these helpfully painted curves .
this is from my group -- a slightly less glamorous computer modeling .
the sound you &apos;re hearing is the light black hole banging on space each time it gets close .
and surely , the space around us is ringing after traveling maybe a million light years , or a million years , at the speed of light to get to us .
the answer is actually 18@@ 6@@ ,@@ 5@@ 40 miles , or seven times around the globe .
swami Da@@ yan@@ anda Saras@@ wat@@ i : the profound journey of compassion
you can be compassionate occasionally , more moved by empathy than by compassion .
no human heart is denied of that empathy .
you cannot command compassion unless you become limitless , and nobody can become limitless , either you are or you are not . period .
a few months ago , I got a phone call from a nursing home where I work .
so I said , &quot; What sort of things ? &quot;
she wasn &apos;t on any medications which could produce hallucinations .
you interact with them .
and it &apos;s that Tuesday evening back in 1982 .
but in fact people say , &quot; I don &apos;t recognize the people . I can &apos;t form any associations . &quot;
Oh look , there &apos;s another galaxy .
a teacher , no matter how good , has to give this one-size-fits-all lecture to 30 students -- blank faces , slightly antagon@@ istic -- and now it &apos;s a human experience .
now that can work well for an individual learner , and I encourage , one , for you to do it with your kids , but I also encourage everyone in the audience to do it yourself .
and I want to make it clear , we don &apos;t view this as the complete math education .
so you &apos;re getting feedback on those teacher views to see what they think they mean ?
and yeah , you can start becoming a mentor , a tutor , really immediately .
it &apos;s got a light organ under its eye .
if I squeeze the tip , they go from tip to base .
so the camera &apos;s black and white .
there &apos;s something small there that responds .
it looks like a little of string pearls basically -- in fact , three strings of pearls .
this is something that should be on everybody &apos;s bucket list , because we live on an ocean planet .
another scientist with very big ideas , the superstar of biology , is Charles Darwin .
and we &apos;ll come back to chromosomes in a minute .
this is the way a living cell looks down a light microscope .
and they &apos;ve got their long legs so they can step around obstacles and so on .
and if so , how did they make arrangements ?
the prisoner &apos;s dilemma is actually a story that &apos;s over@@ laid on a mathematical matrix that came out of the game theory in the early years of thinking about nuclear war : two players who couldn &apos;t trust each other .
which suggests that instead of there being an innate sense of fairness , that somehow the basis of our economic transactions can be influenced by our social institutions , whether we know that or not .
but she also found many instances in which people escaped the prisoner &apos;s dilemma ; in fact , the tragedy of the commons is a multi@@ player prisoner &apos;s dilemma .
Toyota , instead of treating its suppliers as a marketplace , treats them as a network and trains them to produce better , even though they are also training them to produce better for their competitors .
open source production has shown us that world-class software , like Linux and Moz@@ illa , can be created with neither the bureaucratic structure of the firm nor the incentives of the marketplace as we &apos;ve known them .
nothing else .
he is the musical director of Los Angeles Philharmonic , and is still the overall leader of Venezuela &apos;s junior orchestras .
he was the conductor of the Go@@ then@@ burg Symphony Orchestra , and he &apos;s an unbe@@ atable example for young musicians in Latin America and the world .
the spon@@ tane@@ ity music has exclu@@ des it as a luxury item and makes it a patri@@ mony of society .
what I &apos;ll show you very quickly is a new kind of book where it is mixed now with ... all sorts of things live in there , but you have to keep a few things in mind .
the two-@@ headed sli@@ der is a speed control that allows me to watch the movie at various speeds , in forward or reverse .
and a lot of what they do is they pick up the phone , and it &apos;s our system whispering to them which pill they need to take , and they fake like they &apos;re having a conversation with a friend .
and looking at that pattern . and what does that decline in social health mean , as a kind of a vital sign of the future ?
it &apos;s like the lights are on , but nobody &apos;s home on this demographic Y2K + 10 problem . right ?
the first boom@@ er actually , we didn &apos;t even wait till 2011 , next year .
I was like , &quot; Actually it was your idea . you said it in a Fortune Magazine article .
I just extended it . &quot;
it has acceler@@ ome@@ try . you can plug in a three-@@ lead EC@@ G .
but when we look at these cycles of data over a longer period of time -- and we &apos;re looking at everything from motion around different rooms in the house , to sort of micro-@@ motions that Shim@@ mer picks up , about gait and stride length -- these streams of data are starting to tell us things about behavioral patterns that we &apos;ve never understood before .
no matter who pays for it , we better start doing care in a fundamentally different way and treating the home and the patient and the family member and the caregivers as part of these coordinated care teams and using disruptive technologies that are already here to do care in some pretty fundamental different ways .
we &apos;re talking about good , fresh food that is being wasted on a colossal scale .
strange you might think , but if we could rely on corporations to tell us what they were doing in the back of their stores , we wouldn &apos;t need to go snea@@ king around the back , opening up bins and having a look at what &apos;s inside .
we contribute to that squeeze by depositing food in bins here in Britain and elsewhere in the world . we take food off the market shelves that hungry people depend on .
I thought , &quot; My goodness , what taboo have I broken ?
but it is that social thing that I guess attracted Michael C@@ rich@@ ton .
so that &apos;s what we &apos;ve done .
that was interesting .
but birds are dinosaurs .
that &apos;s how people make G@@ lo@@ Fish .
we can make a chicken with teeth .
but as you can see , the pigeon , or a chicken or anything else , another bird , has kind of a weir@@ d-looking hand , because the hand is a wing .
so what we &apos;re trying to do really is take our chicken , modify it and make the chicken@@ osaurus .
and , in fact , everybody &apos;s listed twice , because it &apos;s sorted once by name and once by email address .
so if somebody really wanted to attack the United States or Western civilization these days , they &apos;re not going to do it with tanks .
I &apos;ll meet you at Frigoris . no . I don &apos;t think so .
so , formulas relate number to form .
the reality , now here is something important .
what &apos;s important about this is these shapes are du@@ als of each other .
he &apos;s all mur@@ ky . there is little kids leaning on his leg , little ghosts flying around . we gotta clean this stuff up fast , ladies and gentlemen .
now , Monaco is problematic for me , and I &apos;ll show you why .
in Monaco , &quot; No , what are you talking about ?
I can just divide numbers , that &apos;s like atom smashing .
they are the nodes on the string , patterns and relationships , 27 , 37 .
it just seems like it &apos;s not sexy and elegant , it &apos;s hidden .
so if you ever fanta@@ size about going back in time and seeing what a dinosaur looked like , that &apos;s what a dinosaur looks like .
could you image if we looked through the Hubble Telescope and we saw that ?
so , what I &apos;d like to do now is try a little drawing .
and then his side@@ kick is a sea turtle , as I mentioned before , named Fil@@ more .
and so I killed a character that &apos;s been in the newspaper for 15 years .
and you find other things , and you break that up , and you haul those away .
this is actually a story of my own backyard .
that &apos;s right . now , since I haven &apos;t had the chance to work with these calculators , I need to make sure that they are all working properly .
audience : Oh , 7@@ 22 .
audience : 16@@ 2 .
CA : it was . AB : and it was cloudy .
I store them as words , and later on retrieve them as numbers .
I &apos;m -- The first time you do something , it &apos;s science .
I take lunch hour .
let &apos;s figure out what this is .
whatever it is must be pretty important , because I &apos;ve traveled with it , moved it , from apartment to apartment to apartment .
a play ballet .
and she begins to bab@@ ble and co@@ o and smile , and so does the baby .
the reason I put this here is also to queue up my thoughts about objec@@ tifying what play does .
pretty smart -- they don &apos;t want to get killed by a cat .
and he gives play as a transformative force over his entire life .
because when you need it again , the meeting is literally hanging in your closet .
Hom@@ ar@@ o C@@ ant@@ u and Ben Ro@@ che come from Mo@@ to , a Chicago restaurant that plays with new ways to cook and eat food . but beyond the fun and flav@@ or-@@ tri@@ pping , there &apos;s a serious intent : can we use new food technology for good ?
let &apos;s charge them a bo@@ at@@ load of cash for this and see what they think .
but I still fall into this weird crack where people don &apos;t seem to understand me .
how could it respond , in a way , to acknowledge or sub@@ vert the fact that we &apos;re looking at it ?
and I &apos;m going to show a video of the older version of it , which is just a minute long . okay .
it helps to have good friends .
what we didn &apos;t anticipate was the many , many other uses that would evolve from this very simple system .
and this trend of people using this communication network to help each other out goes far beyond the original idea of just keeping up with family and friends .
so , this would be the Twitter search screen .
but because of writers like Chin@@ ua Ache@@ be and Cam@@ ara La@@ ye I went through a mental shift in my perception of literature .
now , I was quite willing to contend that there were a number of things wrong with the novel , that it had failed in a number of places , but I had not quite imagined that it had failed at achieving something called African authenticity .
the Palestinian poet M@@ ou@@ rid Bar@@ gh@@ out@@ i writes that if you want to dispos@@ sess a people , the simplest way to do it is to tell their story and to start with , &quot; secondly . &quot;
he disagreed . he felt that people who could read , would read , if you made literature affordable and available to them .
it &apos;s not that experts have not massively contributed to the world -- of course they have .
now is the time to face the world with eyes wide open -- yes , using experts to help us figure things out , for sure -- I don &apos;t want to completely do myself out of a job here -- but being aware of their limitations and , of course , also our own .
this book , &quot; Fin@@ ding Darwin &apos;s God , &quot; by Kenne@@ th Miller , is one of the most effective attacks on Intelligent Design that I know , and it &apos;s all the more effective because it &apos;s written by a devout Christian .
and the first paper is a standard scientific paper presenting evidence , &quot; Iri@@ dium La@@ yer at the K-T B@@ oun@@ dary , Pot@@ assi@@ um-@@ Ar@@ g@@ on D@@ ated C@@ rater in Yucatan , In@@ dic@@ ate That an Asteroid Killed the Dinosaurs . &quot;
he stood by it in the face of repeated calls for clari@@ fication or withdraw@@ al .
nevertheless , it &apos;s an un@@ deni@@ able fact that to own up to being an atheist is t@@ ant@@ amount to introducing yourself as Mr. Hitler or Miss Be@@ el@@ ze@@ bu@@ b .
why does this far more substantial minority not make a move to exercise its political muscle ?
what happened was that Aveling &apos;s mistress was Marx &apos;s daughter , and when both Darwin and Marx were dead , Marx &apos;s papers became mu@@ ddled up with Aveling &apos;s papers and a letter from Darwin saying , &quot; My dear sir , thank you very much but I don &apos;t want you to dedicate your book to me , &quot; was mista@@ kenly supposed to be addressed to Marx , and that gave rise to this whole myth , which you &apos;ve probably heard .
we looked at the question , what happens when the battery is disconnected from the car .
why is this a big issue ?
right ? remember in the campaign : one million hybrid cars by 2015 .
you have to remember that the world today is bringing in so many cars .
you &apos;re looking at a world where cars are matched with windmills .
we have to start thinking about giving kick@@ ers to countries that are willing to go to this kind of scale .
he actually shared with me another story , which is from about 200 years ago .
the best way to help Africans today is to help them to stand on their own feet .
that &apos;s the critical change that is being inverted by the Net .
what &apos;s the effect of this ? so , the story that most people know is the story of free or open source software .
you know , the problem is if this virus occasionally mutates so dramatically , it essentially is a new virus and then we get a pandemic .
we can do this .
well , here &apos;s the dirty little secret .
even worse , the most common influenza -- influenza A -- also infects animals that live in close proximity to humans , and they can recombine in those particular animals .
it was easily transmitted , but , luckily , was pretty mild .
if you can crip@@ ple these with specific antibodies , you could crip@@ ple all versions of the flu .
well , with the new technologies emerging now , I hope we can say definitively , &quot; Yes . &quot;
in your mind , Seth -- I mean , you must dream about this -- what is the kind of time scale on , let &apos;s start with HIV , for a game-@@ changing vaccine that &apos;s actually out there and usable ?
CA : in your gut , do you think it &apos;s probably going to be at least another five years ?
and here &apos;s the un@@ romantic truth -- and the city air makes you free , they said in Renaissance Germany . so some people go to places like Shanghai but most go to the squatter cities where aesthetics rule .
the third fundamental issue that we have to recognize is that if we want to help the African people , we must know where the African people are .
as a matter of fact , we neglected the informal and the traditional sectors .
without the council the chief can &apos;t pass any law , and if the chief doesn &apos;t govern according to the will of the people he will be removed .
that is not the kind of system Africans had known for centuries .
yes , it &apos;s an enterprise .
figure out some of the other options that are much better . it &apos;s important .
if you take a sea urchin larva from 8.1 , put it in a pH of 7@@ .7 -- not a huge change -- it becomes deformed and dies .
coral reefs are growing slower in some places because of this problem .
and there &apos;s basically nobody there anymore , a few people trying to keep using it .
and he moved away because it was his last fishing trip , and he knew that the dolphins scare fish .
we &apos;re starting with something that &apos;s had a lot of stresses and a lot of problems to begin with .
the booms are only about 13 inches in diameter .
here are shrimp boats employed .
you can see that corporations were illegal at the founding of America , and even Thomas Jefferson complained that they were already bidding de@@ fiance to the laws of our country .
that &apos;s what it would really mean to be conservative .
I like hearing what they &apos;re thinking about ; I like seeing what they link to ; I like learning a thing or two .
but when you do read the links , it &apos;s really quite remarkable .
and in the 1970s and &apos; 80s , a team of scientists mapped all 7,000 connections between the neurons .
and there &apos;s a lot of evidence that neural activity can cause your connections to change .
one : the soft properties of the magnet that make it so that , if it were to hit the rider in the head , it wouldn &apos;t injure him .
woman : I would make a spear that , when you went deep sea diving , you could catch the fish really fast , and then roll it back up , and you could swim easier ... Yeah .
that is until last year , when Eduardo won the Cou@@ p de Co@@ eur , the coveted French gastron@@ omic prize .
big , big problem .
even though they were imprisoned in this Garden of Eden with figs and everything else .
you want to look and see what good foie gras is , it &apos;s got to be bright yellow .
well , because he doesn &apos;t force feed , because he doesn &apos;t gavage tons of corn , his livers were pretty grey .
they don &apos;t need anything more . &quot;
but this was transformative . really transformative .
but I can taste things .
what ?
so for instance , several governments in Africa and Eastern Europe are opening their budgets to the public .
me , I have strictly no power to change anything .
voice off@@ stage : four point five .
some million years after -- p@@ shoo-@@ shoo , blo@@ op-@@ bloop -- ah , wake up !
there is so many things to do ; it &apos;s so fresh .
the first , if you want -- there is so many -- but one which is very easy to do , is the duty of vision .
because we have almost finished , I &apos;ll repeat this story .
people did not believe this .
&quot; what are we going to do ? &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know . &quot;
they are not lux@@ uries .
I know those hands and eyes ; they touched me as well .
now we know from neuroscience that compassion has some very extraordinary qualities .
women have manife@@ sted for thousands of years the strength ar@@ ising from compassion in an unfiltered , un@@ mediated way in perceiving suffering as it is .
they all went through , and then the border patrol saw my American passport .
just do it outside , please . &quot;
and one thing that happened there was also the Pakistani Taliban took credit for that failed car bombing .
so I went over , &quot; Ex@@ cuse me , sir , are you my driver ? &quot;
it &apos;s an application that I think will be useful for artists -- multimedia artists in particular .
he had this wonderful trick where a ros@@ e@@ bush would bloom right in front of your eyes .
maybe there is a link , a commercial link , between one organization and another one .
and there are three main stages .
the same thing happened , of course , in the world of crime and terror .
and no matter how long I &apos;ve spent on the ocean , I haven &apos;t yet managed to muster a decent beard , and I hope that it remains that way .
well , I plan my route so that I &apos;m drifting with the winds and the currents while I &apos;m sleeping .
whereas if you look in Google Earth , this is how the Pacific looks .
now , which would you rather be ? a grid , or manifest destiny ?
&quot; when it &apos;s all said and done , it &apos;s got to look like seaweed , &quot; said the owner .
when I was 11 , I wanted to be left alone .
we both got moved to the back of class so we would stop getting bombarded by sp@@ it@@ balls .
and we can violate your expectations in a whole variety of ways about representation , about shape , about color and so forth and it &apos;s very primal . and it &apos;s an interesting question to ponder , why these things -- we find these things joyful . why would we find them joyful ? so , here &apos;s something that Lionel did a while ago . I like these sort of little things like this .
contemporary artists in India are having a conversation with the world like never before .
he &apos;s putting a contemporary spin on the miniature tradition .
Mum@@ bai@@ -based D@@ h@@ ru@@ vi A@@ char@@ ya builds on her love of comic books and street art to comment on the roles and expectations of modern Indian women .
for example , in my first TEDTalk , I did propose that we should spend 21 billion hours a week as a planet playing video games .
it &apos;s true . hospice workers , the people who take care of us at the end of our lives , recently issued a report on the most frequently expressed regrets that people say when they are literally on their death@@ beds .
a recent study from &#91; University of Michigan &#93; showed that these games are incredibly powerful relation@@ shi@@ p-@@ management tools .
the next few minutes is , we &apos;re all going to get raised up to the level of a sea slug .
infinity . you all got it right . exactly .
we want to propose , Ch@@ ris@@ sy and I , through The Institute for F@@ ig@@ uring , another alternative way of doing things , which is the play tank .
and I said -- I got worried , I said , my God , I mean I &apos;ve changed this guy &apos;s body image , what about human subjects , ethics and all of that ?
now , why does this happen ?
speaking as both an astronomer and &quot; a concerned member of the human race , &quot; Sir Martin Re@@ es examines our planet and its future from a cosmic perspective . he urges action to prevent dark consequences from our scientific and technological development .
my talk will be in two parts . I &apos;ll talk first as an astronomer , and then as a worried member of the human race .
so there could be another universe just a millimeter away from ours , but we &apos;re not aware of it because that millimeter is measured in some fourth spatial dimension , and we &apos;re imprisoned in our three .
you want to not only synthesize the very large and the very small , but we want to understand the very complex .
we depend on chemistry to determine our complex structure .
Bio@@ - and cyber@@ technologies are environmentally benign in that they offer marvelous prospects , while , nonetheless , reducing pressure on energy and resources .
it was what he called &quot; fine-grained re@@ lin@@ qui@@ shment . &quot;
and also , when a scientist makes a discovery , he or she normally has no clue what the applications are going to be .
and I think we have to go back to what happened in the post-@@ War era , post-@@ World War II , when the nuclear scientists who &apos;d been involved in making the atomic bomb , in many cases were concerned that they should do all they could to alert the world to the dangers .
we divided our world up with lots of categories .
and I don &apos;t really think it &apos;s in our biology ; I think we &apos;ve attributed it to our biology , but I don &apos;t really think it &apos;s there .
long and careful studies have reported many new findings on them .
realizing that Nyota might get hurt , Panbanisha , like any human mother , carefully tu@@ gs to get the scissors back .
do that real fast part that you did . yeah , that part .
but some people bought a coffee for themselves , the way they usually would , but other people said that they bought a coffee for somebody else .
maybe you have something in mind , maybe not .
you and I can go on and buy it for them .
I was not the only person editing the open street map .
fifty years ago in the old Soviet Union , a team of engineers was secretly moving a large object through a desolate countryside .
now when I got out , I was diagnosed and I was given medications by a psychiatrist .
maybe no one &apos;s really crazy .
so to put the question a little more seriously , let &apos;s ask ourselves what are the minimum requirements for what you just did , for spontaneous synchron@@ ization .
you &apos;re used to suspension bridges with big dro@@ opy cables on the top .
interviewer : ah ! now , tell me why you had to do this ?
interviewer : so just show me how you walk normally . right .
Steven Stro@@ g@@ atz : all right , so that already gives you a hint of what happened .
so already , the simulator is making me walk in exactly the same way as our witnesses walked on the real bridge .
and be careful , your genes are in danger .
they need to look forward to exploration ; they need to look forward to colonization ; they need to look forward to breakthroughs .
there &apos;s a group of people that have come forward -- and you don &apos;t know all of them -- but the ones that have come forward were inspired as young children , this little three- to 15-year-old age , by us going to orbit and going to the moon here , right in this time period .
but the interesting thing about it is the commercial guys are going to go first .
Sputnik wasn &apos;t a technical loss , but it was a prestige loss .
but , you know , would you have thought back in the &apos; 60s , when the space race was going on , that the first commercial capit@@ ali@@ st-@@ like thing to do to buy a ticket to go to the moon would be in Russian hardware ?
and , in fact , cancers don &apos;t start out with a blood supply .
but once angiogenesis occurs , cancers can grow exponentially .
we call this antiangiogenic therapy , and it &apos;s completely different from chemotherapy because it selectively aims at the blood vessels that are feeding the cancers .
the bars represent survival time taken from the era in which there was only chemotherapy , or surgery , or radiation available .
and here are the dietary factors going head to head against these drugs .
for the last 20 years I &apos;ve been designing puzzles .
you &apos;re going to move the blue one up in order to get the la@@ ven@@ der one to the right .
Namaste . good morning .
and then let &apos;s remember that we &apos;ve been taught the exact opposite by the powers that be , that compassion clouds your thinking , that it gets in the way , that vulnerability is weakness , that emotions are not to be trusted , and you &apos;re not supposed to take things personally , which is one of my favorites .
to be a leader means not to be a girl .
and I &apos;d also like to say that the irony of course , is that denying girl , suppressing girl , suppressing emotion , refusing feeling has lead thus here .
on my way here on the airplane , I was walking up and down the aisle of the plane .
I &apos;ve seen girls be treated like garbage cans .
and that is the power of transformation .
the mathematicians who were saying these were path@@ ologically useless shapes ?
you have a huge ring .
here &apos;s an aerial photograph of one of the An@@ as@@ az@@ i ruins ; you can see it &apos;s circular at the largest scale , but it &apos;s rectangular at the smaller scale , right ?
you have constant feedback . you have daily update sessions .
in 1983 , Jeff Sutherland was a technologist at a financial firm in New England .
that assumes , as parents , we can anticipate every problem that &apos;s going to arise .
so the bottom line is , empower your children .
we did the family equivalent of a corporate retreat .
another great way to tell your story is to tell your children where they came from .
so my final plank is , tell your story .
did you guess the one that was dry ?
♫ Plato in the cave with those very young boys . ♫ Sweeney : ooh ...
do you guys know about that movie &quot; The Secret &quot; ?
or think about the fact that if you build an automobile , I &apos;ll tell you that you also -- inside it -- have to put a factory that allows you to make another automobile .
and you can absolutely never , absolutely never , because of history and the inherited plan , start with a clean slate .
so , you can put those properties in . it inspired them to show off this design by producing a little robot they named Sp@@ ra@@ wl .
it actually leaps into the air , and has aerial phases when it does it , like a horse , and you &apos;ll see it &apos;s bouncing here .
and here &apos;s some video at 1,000 frames per second .
see it un@@ curl and then peel these toes .
we were fortunate to work with another group at Stanford that built us a special manned sensor , that we were able to measure the force of an individual hair .
when we measured the forces , they were enormous .
a recent study in the U.S .
in the high-income part of our workforce , in the people who end up at the top -- Fortune 500 CEO jobs , or the equivalent in other industries -- the problem , I am convinced , is that women are dropping out .
and she &apos;s an operator in a company in Silicon Valley , and she uses her contacts to become a very successful venture capitalist .
but Heidi ? not so sure .
studies show that households with equal earning and equal responsibility also have half the divorce rate .
we are not going to get to where 50 percent of the population -- in my generation , there will not be 50 percent of &#91; women &#93; at the top of any industry .
I want my son to have a choice to contribute fully in the workforce or at home , and I want my daughter to have the choice to not just succeed , but to be liked for her accomplishments .
after Mr. Hei@@ fetz &apos;s concert a lady came over and complimented , &quot; Oh , Mr. Hei@@ fetz , your violin sounded so great tonight . &quot;
they wanted to capture one other variable , which was the patients &apos; sense of efficacy .
but the problem is that things -- in the upper-@@ right corner there -- personalized data , it &apos;s been pretty hard to come by .
it goes on and on and on , all these values , all these numbers you don &apos;t know .
we use the person &apos;s age and their gender to start to fill in the personalized risks .
this is information that is incredibly powerful .
it &apos;s not my idea , other people have hit on it , but I &apos;ve tried to take it to some new places .
you suddenly realize that consciousness -- which we value and we consider the crow@@ ning achievement of nature , human consciousness -- is really just another set of tools for getting along in the world .
you can see that Japan is busy at night , right there .
why don &apos;t they like my blog ? &quot;
but this next decade -- and that &apos;s a real thing .
four . back at SC@@ V@@ NG@@ R , we like to joke that with seven game dynamics , you can get anyone to do anything .
this is a local company called Vit@@ ality , and they &apos;ve created a product to help people take their medicine on time .
I thought , at the time , I did a pretty good job .
I &apos;m a fully pa@@ id@@ -up member of that priesthood , and somewhere in here I have my designer glasses .
instead of starting with technology , the team started with people and culture .
so these are some that we &apos;ve been asked to think about recently .
such small differences in the way we administered the activity yielded striking differences in how well they performed .
the assumption then that we do best when the individual self chooses only holds when that self is clearly divided from others .
so bring it on , Walmart , with 100,000 different products , and Amazon , with 27 million books and Mat@@ ch@@ .com with -- what is it ? -- 15 million date possibilities now .
a sociologist from the War@@ saw Survey Agency explained , &quot; The older generation jumped from nothing to choice all around them .
these parents could not contemplate giving up the choice , because to do so would have gone contrary to everything they had been taught and everything they had come to believe about the power and purpose of choice .
Americans have so often tried to disseminate their ideas of choice , believing that they will be , or ought to be , welcomed with open hearts and minds .
and the other one was called &quot; Ad@@ orable . &quot;
what &apos;s different about them ? &quot;
and so I realized that actually the tech world is best understood , not as a business cycle , but as a messi@@ anic movement .
the rocket &apos;s position is shown by the trajectory that we &apos;re now looking at .
and as it reaches the peak of its trajectory , the velocity , you will notice , has dropped off to a minimum .
put out your Magic Win@@ dow and your erasing glove , and rub it like this .
you have extreme concern with everybody else &apos;s business and much involvement in everybody else &apos;s life .
pH : we &apos;ll talk a little bit more about him later .
it &apos;s the era of big business and data centers for computing .
and when I say that code expresses our hopes and aspirations , it &apos;s not just a joke about messi@@ anism , it &apos;s actually what we do .
I think these ideas are difficult to understand , because when you &apos;re trapped in one paradigm , the next paradigm is always like a science fiction universe -- it makes no sense .
you think he &apos;s a nice bal@@ ding guy , but he &apos;s just declared war on the content business . find the commercial stuff , mash it up , tell the story your way .
it just goes to show how tough it is to come up with the right uses of media .
pH : I think it &apos;s a great time of enthr@@ all@@ ment .
and , you know , that no longer exists .
when I was five years old I fell in love with airplanes .
I wanted to build airplanes .
we stole the idea from bicycle seats , and put gel in the cushions and in the arm@@ rests to absorb point load -- distributes the loading so you don &apos;t get hard spots .
clearly the product you &apos;ve got has got to be safe to humans .
so here &apos;s a typical situation , male meets female , lots of offspring .
this is my life . these are my life places .
we all have these .
for every community in the United States , you could have your own personalized map of that .
this is how Paul did it . he did it with his iPhone .
he forms an attachment to kin@@ d-@@ of-@@ dit@@ z@@ y-@@ bu@@ t-@@ still-@@ sen@@ d@@ s-@@ gin@@ ger-@@ snap@@ s-@@ for-@@ Christ@@ mas@@ .@@ mom , who downloads the boy in the orchard , the emperor of oranges , who grows up to be me -- the guy who usually goes too far .
so , whenever you lost information , you &apos;d move to symmetry ; whenever you added information to a system , you would break symmetry .
you know , I haven &apos;t verified this , but it &apos;s the norm that every chair would be a slightly different dimension , because you &apos;d want to space them all out for everybody &apos;s sight lines .
now , this suggests that if you could just block waterborne transmission , you could cause disease organisms to shift from the right-hand side of that graph to the left-hand side of the graph .
and it flu@@ shes out thousands of different other competitors that would otherwise make life difficult for the Vi@@ bri@@ os .
there &apos;s a little ethical problem in this experiment .
she got rehydration therapy , she per@@ ked up , within a few days she was looking like a completely different person .
and Peru &apos;s got something sort of in between .
so it &apos;s intuitive , and it works pretty well .
so you might say , let &apos;s go to the brain and put something in the brain to record signals , or in the end of the peripheral nerve and record them there .
you think , &quot; B@@ end elbow , &quot; a different section contracts .
I was able to use my elbow and my hand simultaneously .
and I also have the hand closed and open .
so the exciting part isn &apos;t so much the mech@@ at@@ ronics , but the control .
and when I came at age 22 to live on Fer@@ n@@ and@@ ina , let me just say , that I had never camped before .
and so we have this penguin project . the Wildlife Conservation Society has funded me along with a lot of individuals over the last 27 years to be able to produce these kinds of maps .
so that means as their mate is sitting on the nest incub@@ ating the eggs , the other one is out there foraging , and the longer they have to stay gone , the worse condition the mate is in when the mate comes back .
as long as the city &apos;s putting out notices like this to try to get people engaged , then of course people aren &apos;t going to be engaged .
and what they found was that people who lived to 90 or 100 were more likely to have daf-2 mutations -- that is , changes in the gene that encodes the receptor for IGF-1 .
as you age , you &apos;re much more likely to get cancer , Alzheimer &apos;s disease , heart disease , all sorts of diseases .
in the United States alone , 100,000 men , women and children are on the waiting list for donor organs , and more than a dozen die each day because of a lack of donor organs .
and in some areas , the commercial gi@@ fting of an organ in exchange for monetary reward has led to a flourishing trade in living , unrelated donors .
but in 2007 , two remarkable individuals , Sh@@ in@@ ya Yam@@ an@@ aka of Japan and Jamie Thom@@ son of the United States , made an astounding discovery .
and the approach , of course , also works in moving , behaving animals .
whenever a fly reaches the mid@@ point of the chamber where the two odor streams meet , it has to make a decision .
they &apos;re climbing up a wall , or a tree .
so for TED we actually built a robot , over there , a prototype , with the tail .
that is , whether you care about security , search and rescue or health , we must preserve nature &apos;s designs , otherwise these secrets will be lost forever .
woman : the difference is that the Israeli military is still stronger .
narrator : it &apos;s about the liberation struggle .
Brian Gre@@ ene on string theory
so Kaluza said , well , maybe there are more dimensions of space .
number one : if there are more dimensions in space , where are they ?
he suggested that dimensions might come in two varieties -- there might be big , eas@@ y-@@ to-@@ see dimensions , but there might also be tiny , cur@@ le@@ d-up dimensions , curled up so small , even though they &apos;re all around us , that we don &apos;t see them .
but if we zoom in and take the perspective of , say , a little ant walking around -- little ants are so small that they can access all of the dimensions -- the long dimension , but also this clockwise , counter-@@ clockwise direction .
the idea is like this .
and there you see unification , because matter particles , electrons and quarks , radiation particles , photons , gravit@@ ons , are all built up from one entity .
one of the other predictions of string theory -- no , that &apos;s not one of the other predictions of string theory .
it &apos;s a machine that will send particles around a tunnel , opposite directions , near the speed of light .
and if it drifts away in the right pattern that we can calculate , this will be evidence that the extra dimensions are there .
and then the last thing on the list there , ocean acidification -- if you were to ask me , you know , &quot; What do you worry about the most ?
so what that means is , what it tells us is that the Ross Sea region , this ice shelf , melted back and formed anew about 35 times .
and we just count on down to the bottom .
some of them show greater variability .
but they all tell us what the natural variability is .
right now , about a third of that carbon dioxide is dis@@ solving straight into the sea , right ?
and on coral reefs , where some of the main framework organisms disappear , we will see a major loss of marine biodiversity .
and you &apos;ll notice you see a dark brown tile at the top , and a bright orange tile at the side .
and what I &apos;m going to do is , I &apos;m going to hold it here , and I &apos;m going to spin it .
because I think only through uncertainty is there potential for understanding .
we make them every day -- last night in my hotel room , when I decided to double-@@ lock the door , or you in your car when you drove here , when we go eat lunch and decide the food &apos;s not poison and we &apos;ll eat it .
we make these trade-offs again and again , multiple times a day .
we &apos;re really good at small numbers .
okay , so what makes people not notice ?
he had some very complex models of how to survive .
I flew here yesterday .
the seeds -- some of if is very un@@ technical .
and that enables us to develop germin@@ ation protocols .
a few were still there with bad grades .
that person ate the marshmallow .
and then it was abandoned .
but you see that happening on the High Line , and I think that &apos;s the power that public space can have to transform how people experience their city and interact with each other .
amongst all the troubling deficits we struggle with today -- we think of financial and economic primarily -- the ones that concern me most is the deficit of political dialogue -- our ability to address modern conflicts as they are , to go to the source of what they &apos;re all about and to understand the key players and to deal with them .
the rules of engagement : how to talk , when to talk , and how to deal with them .
and there are times you should walk .
and my country relies on its security through military alliance , that &apos;s clear .
we can only solve this through a political solution .
she says , &quot; Oh , that &apos;s beautiful .
and I could sense that she thought I was speaking synecdochically .
so , the Jo@@ die Foster character here is actually this woman , Jill Tarter , and Jill has dedicated her life to this .
the architect spent hundreds of hours designing the bur@@ nished brass swit@@ ch@@ plates for his new office tower .
that &apos;s the end of that .
they offer a pleasant respite from the high-@@ density development around them .
in 1962 the un@@ sold stock was purchased by Maur@@ ice Ha@@ ver@@ piece , a wealthy prune juice bot@@ t@@ ler , and consolidated to form the core collection .
what we &apos;re really here to talk about is the &quot; how . &quot;
and they had discussed things of great national importance .
notice it looks like something out of a Pe@@ an@@ uts cartoon .
and you know what changed his life ? it was walking into one of these , a Boys and Girls Club .
pretty much everybody else who does polls .
so let me start with genomics .
but it has its limitations .
I can make them healthy . &quot;
but it &apos;s limited , because really to know if it &apos;s a healthy restaurant , you need to taste the food , you need to know what goes on in the kitchen , you need the product of all of those ingredients .
it &apos;s the one theory that the biologists ever really got right .
I kept getting this call from this oncologist named David Agus .
they are working to create a new imagination about shared life among young Jews and Muslims , and as they do that , they cultivate what they call &quot; curiosity without assumptions . &quot;
and I don &apos;t imagine that you will realize this when you look at this photograph of him , but he &apos;s paraplegic .
we don &apos;t hear about the Einstein who used his celebrity to advocate for political prisoners in Europe or the Scot@@ ts@@ bor@@ o boys in the American South .
Einstein believed deeply that science should transcend national and ethnic divisions .
well , he was complicated .
he said that such a man would be in a lunatic asylum , if he existed at all .
and I often think that they have the best of all worlds .
here &apos;s Margaret A@@ tw@@ ood , &quot; Cat &apos;s Eye . &quot;
it was my version of my grandfather &apos;s hours of the day alone in his library .
everybody &apos;s betting their life on something .
that &apos;s kind of a no-brainer .
so I believe , essentially , that leadership is stewardship .
it makes a difference what you believe .
because I start getting all kinds of invitations .
when you read this prayer , it sounds incredibly selfish , self-@@ centered .
and so the purpose of influence is to speak up for those who have no influence .
I have a church full of CEOs and scientists .
so , I had to say , &quot; OK , I would use whatever affluence and whatever influence I &apos;ve got to help those who don &apos;t have either of those . &quot;
did you know that God smiles when you be you ?
and then I &apos;ll come back to the beginning , and tell you a little bit more -- hopefully convince you -- that I believe that in today &apos;s world , it is really important for business leaders not only to have an idea of what their business is all about , but to have a passion for something that is meaningful .
so I grew up in a family of women .
those of you who &apos;ve never looked at their website , you should look at it . it &apos;s really impressive . and you can see how the Internet penetration has changed over the years .
and then when you say children , they will pretty quickly agree with you .
you and I didn &apos;t have 10,000 books when we went to primary school .
so it &apos;s 1995 , I &apos;m in college , and a friend and I go on a road trip from Pro@@ vi@@ dence , Rhode Island to Portland , Oregon .
but the thing is , the coyote runs off the cliff right after him .
this internal sense of rightness that we all experience so often is not a reliable guide to what is actually going on in the external world .
but it &apos;s also a huge social problem .
it &apos;s like we want to imagine that our minds are just these perfectly translucent windows and we just gaze out of them and describe the world as it unfolds .
86 percent of the energy we consume are hydrocarbons . that means 86 percent of the stuff we &apos;re consuming are probably processed plants and amoe@@ bas and the rest of the stuff . and there &apos;s a role in here for conservation . there &apos;s a role in here for alternative stuff , but we &apos;ve also got to get that other portion right .
but as we started asking ourselves about how we were addressing the higher needs of our employees and our customers , I realized we had no metrics .
at age 17 , he started asking the kinds of questions that you &apos;d expect of someone with a beginner &apos;s mind .
over dinner , I asked him an imper@@ tin@@ ent question .
the Bhutanese aren &apos;t on some aspirational treadmill , constantly focused on what they don &apos;t have .
we &apos;re spending 10 billion dollars on the census .
we &apos;re asking 10 simple questions -- it is simplicity .
we count on people .
everyone over there shout .
it shor@@ tens the lives of the people who live there in the Gulf .
so oil and petrochemicals are not just a problem where there &apos;s a spill ; they &apos;re a problem where there &apos;s not .
and so poor people who are making these products in petrochemical centers like &quot; Cancer Alley , &quot; poor people who are consuming these products disproportionately , and then poor people , who even at the tail end of the recycling are having their lives shor@@ tened , are all being harmed greatly by this addiction that we have to disposability .
now you think to yourself -- because I know how you are -- you say , &quot; That sure is terrible for those poor people .
and , yeah , I &apos;m proud , too .
and yet , as a movement that has to broaden its constituency , that has to grow , that has to reach out beyond our natural comfort zone , one of the challenges to the success of this movement , of getting rid of things like plastic and helping the economy shift , is people look at our movement with some suspicion .
a poor person , a low-income person , somebody in &quot; Cancer Alley , &quot; somebody in Wat@@ ts , somebody in Harlem , somebody on an Indian reservation , might say to themselves , and ri@@ ghtfully so , &quot; How can these people be so passionate about making sure that a plastic bottle has a second chance in life , or an aluminum can has a second chance , and yet , when my child gets in trouble and goes to prison , he doesn &apos;t get a second chance ? &quot;
another difference , and I have to describe this , because it &apos;s very personal , another great difference between the helicopter and the volantor -- in my case the Skycar volantor -- is the experience that I &apos;ve had in flying both of those .
and we had very small power plants in it at this time .
if you want to stay alive you &apos;ve got to have back@@ ups .
only seven percent said that they wouldn &apos;t consider buying a Skycar .
so when you talk about expensive power , the cost per kilo@@ watt-@@ hour to supply battery power to something is on the order of two to three hundred pounds .
it &apos;s a resonant phenomenon for which he actually received a MacArthur Fel@@ lowship Award , which is nick@@ named the Gen@@ ius Award , last September , for his discovery .
and actually , the magnetic fields we &apos;re using are basically about the same as the Earth &apos;s magnetic field .
it &apos;s odd . it has a battery .
they could go in the floor . they could go , actually , underneath your desktop .
second , we are both responsible for and the victims of our own pollution .
and this includes 5,000 pounds of mercury from our dental fill@@ ings alone every year .
so when I die , the Infinity Mush@@ rooms will recognize my body and be able to eat it .
just a little .
but let me tell you -- it doesn &apos;t affect his day job .
this process is a very calculated process .
Hollywood would spend millions of dollars to do a small urban corridor for a movie because they &apos;d have to do it manually .
what we &apos;re trying to do is build a virtual world .
actually , exactly the opposite is what I &apos;m going to do .
actually the country with more telephones is the Soviet Union , and the data referred to 1989 .
that &apos;s not too good .
that &apos;s because the two countries have about the same population size .
I haven &apos;t told you about the definition of literacy .
but that doesn &apos;t mean that you &apos;re a bad basketball player .
that &apos;s its great claim to fame , and I wanted to show it to you , not because I want to give you the kind of Starbucks tour of historic England , but rather because the English coffeehouse was crucial to the development and spread of one of the great intellectual flo@@ wer@@ ings of the last 500 years , what we now call the Enlightenment .
but in fact , if you go back and look at the historical record , it turns out that a lot of important ideas have very long incubation periods -- I call this the &quot; slow hunch . &quot;
Darwin himself , in his auto@@ biography , tells the story of coming up with the idea for natural selection as a classic &quot; eureka ! &quot; moment .
there &apos;s this , you know , man-made satellite up there in outer space that &apos;s obviously broadcasting some kind of signal .
they got on a boat , and yet another divergence -- the boat was either going to Canada or to Australia .
and the first thing that makes me think is that blood vessels are like highways for the tumor cells .
without angiogenesis , the tumor remains the size of a pinpoint and it &apos;s not harmful .
the family had a small shed on the side of the house , so I said , &quot; Could I sleep in my sleeping bag in the evenings ? &quot;
it was very obvious , from the very beginning , that she was a leader .
and in the course of the grandmother talking to the translator , the grandmother started crying .
so at about 1 a.m. , the whole room would be like 20 below zero , and I &apos;d get up .
Natasha wanted to introduce her brother and father to all the villagers , and the day we showed up turned out to be a 6@@ 0-year-old man &apos;s birthday .
the adoption people told us it was going to take a year for the adoption to go through .
we are not going to see the image of the star and the planet as this .
and that &apos;s what many people now are trying to do .
it could be some virus types .
this wasn &apos;t just an economic story .
that &apos;s the consumer society , and it propels economic growth more than even technological change itself .
he was an expert in Latin American history .
Cher@@ yl Hay@@ ash@@ i studies spider silk , one of nature &apos;s most high-performance materials . each species of spider can make up to 7 very different kinds of silk . how do they do it ? Hay@@ ash@@ i explains at the DNA level -- then shows us how this super-@@ strong , super-@@ flexible material can inspire .
clay Shirky on institutions vs. collaboration
tagging was pioneered by De@@ li@@ cious and Joshua Sch@@ ach@@ ter .
this is called a power-@@ law distribution .
most of the cooperative systems we &apos;ve seen haven &apos;t been around long enough to have gotten to the acceptance phase .
sta@@ y-@@ at-@@ home moms . right ?
and this is what every student has to begin with .
the proteins have to set up , strengthen and firm up .
and while it &apos;s growing , all these literal transformations are taking place .
but dough is what we &apos;re working with , and we take that dough to the oven , and it goes into the oven . as soon as the interior temperature of that dough crosses the threshold of 140 degrees , it passes what we call the &quot; thermal death point . &quot;
but we can ask the question , &quot; But is it music ? &quot;
so in that regard , this is one of the things , this is one of the privile@@ ges of being , and here &apos;s another role , the inventor , and by the way , when I told you that I &apos;m the world &apos;s greatest , if you &apos;re keeping score , we &apos;ve had narcissi@@ sm and soli@@ psi@@ sm and now a healthy dose of ego@@ centr@@ icism .
I get to write , sometimes for solo@@ ists and I get to work with one person , sometimes full orchestras , and I work with a lot of people , and this is probably the capacity , the role creatively for which I &apos;m probably best known professionally .
if we look across many , many different species of animals , not just us primates , but also including other mammals , birds , even mar@@ su@@ pi@@ als like kangar@@ oos and wom@@ bats , it turns out that there &apos;s a relationship between how long a childhood a species has and how big their brains are compared to their bodies and how smart and flexible they are .
and there &apos;s been a revolution in our understanding of machine learning recently .
what Cri@@ stine did was use our B@@ lic@@ ket De@@ tec@@ tors .
so when we say that babies and young children are bad at paying attention , what we really mean is that they &apos;re bad at not paying attention .
it &apos;s good to be a grownup .
but if what we want is to be like those butterflies , to have open-@@ mindedness , open learning , imagination , creativity , innovation , maybe at least some of the time we should be getting the adults to start thinking more like children .
the tricky bit is now to put an AI controller in it that actually makes it work .
and again , if you move the obstacle a tiny bit , it &apos;ll again fall differently .
I &apos;m going to push it a bit harder now , harder than I just pushed Chris .
the first thing , as I said , is going to be virtual stun@@ tmen .
Hi everyone .
I went to this very proper Christian school taught by nuns , fathers , brothers , sisters .
and my argument &#91; is &#93; that the only way for us to teach creativity is by teaching children perspectives at the earliest stage .
-- you go up to the Fi@@ le menu and you choose &quot; New . &quot; now , what happens when you choose &quot; New ? &quot; do you get a new blank document ?
so it &apos;s big , so it &apos;s slow . you &apos;ve got nowhere to go . I &apos;m not doing this for praise .
I am Bill Gates and I write the code .
here we go . Whoa ! it &apos;s magnetic . it doesn &apos;t pull the laptop onto the floor .

CA : Bra@@ vo .
we started looking at things like death rates in the 20th century , and how they &apos;d been improved , and very simple things turned out .
I had one business plan where I was trying to learn more about Wit@@ ten &apos;s cosmic dimension strings to try to understand what the phenomenon was going on in this proposed nanomat@@ erial .
the whole green dream -- because it can be profitable .
we need better surveillance .
and the difference between a normal flu season and a pandemic is about a factor of 1,000 in deaths and certainly enormous economic impact .
so if you tie that -- you have to tie that back with the law .
and growing up as we have , and holding very high the value of free speech , this is a hard thing for us to accept -- for all of us to accept .
the mystery persisted for about 20 years .
which , I guess , you know , communicates to you that I did not think that one was really worth the price .
I did a blind taste test of this with 20 people and five other olive oils .
it &apos;s fully automated -- you walk towards it , and the seat lifts .
this is Cu@@ eva de V@@ illa Lu@@ z in Tab@@ as@@ co , in Mexico , and this cave is saturated with sulfuric acid .
interestingly enough , they also do this with uranium and chrom@@ ium , and various other toxic metals .
if you send a thousand of them , you could probably get rid of 90 percent of them and still have a mission .
did life start here and was it transported there ?
take a few seconds and think of your personal biggest goal , okay ?
I &apos;m Ellen , and I &apos;m totally obsessed with food .
earlier this year , a virtual asteroid in it sold for 3@@ 30,000 real dollars .
and this is a Titan class ship in the space game , E@@ V@@ E Online .
because it &apos;s very powerful . it &apos;s pretty awesome .
because what you can measure in virtuality is everything .
now , if you take a game like Warcraft , you can think about it , if you like , as a great bo@@ x-@@ opening effort .
they &apos;re not rational about probability .
you break things down into these calibrated slices that people can choose and do in parallel to keep them engaged and that you can use to point them towards individually beneficial activities .
fourth , feedback .
it &apos;s very hard to learn , to feel a lesson .
this is a really exciting sequence of me sleeping .
a 24@@ -year-old road swe@@ eper . I caught her on her lunch break .
his wish was to make some money and open a store .
and I said , &quot; You mean , like a cave ? &quot; and she said , &quot; Yeah , like a cave . &quot;
I asked her a little bit more about the cave and what she planned would happen once she went there , you know .
and up there , there are thousands of prayer flags that people have spread out over the years .
and we re-@@ inflated all of the balloons , put them up on a string , and hung them up there among the prayer flags .
I &apos;d like to call it the lost art of productively losing control .
I &apos;ll go through the three basic configurations .
here you see the various acoustic ba@@ ffles as well as the flying mechanisms and cat@@ walks over the auditorium .
Golan Levin on software art
I &apos;d just like to show a clip from a most recent project .
he was telling the truth . because in a different culture , the dog is a sur@@ ro@@ gate for you , you know , &quot; today , &quot; &quot; this month , &quot; &quot; since the rainy season &quot; -- there are lots of opportunities for misunderstanding , and so an issue here is to , in some cases , to figure out how to deal with matters that seem uninteresting , like compliance .
here is another example of something which is -- this is a little spectro@@ phot@@ ometer .
the last 20 years has been the age of intervention , and Afghanistan is simply one act in a five-@@ act tragedy .
if the Al-Qaeda base was to be established near G@@ haz@@ ni , we would hit them very hard , and it would be very , very difficult for the Taliban to protect them .
there was amazing improvements .
you feel deep , deep guilt .
we need to somehow get their message to the policymakers .
when they go out , they travel in these curious ar@@ mo@@ red vehicles with these somewhat threatening security teams who ready 24 hours in advance who say you can only stay on the ground for an hour .
Bosnia and Kosovo were signal successes , great successes .
we could have done that .
but yeah , what &apos;s the matter with Arkansas ?
and Bell then goes on to explain to the students .
in fact , some of you might well know that the barber pole , the red and white stripes , represents the blood bandages of the barber surgeon , and the receptac@@ les on either end represent the pots in which the blood was collected .
and as I wondered what he was up to , his stick fingers made their way up to his pa@@ j@@ ama shirt , f@@ um@@ bling with his buttons .
this was given to us by NBC D@@ at@@ eline to test .
it &apos;s a piece of plastic with a Radio Shack antenna attached to it .
so the way it works is , you go down the hallway and you see if it til@@ ts toward a particular locker , and then you open the locker .
or that the &quot; World We@@ e@@ kly News &quot; makes stuff up ?
so , although it &apos;s possible that most of these things are fake or illusions or so on and that some of them are real , it &apos;s more likely that all of them are fake , like the crop circles .
there was a lot of people there -- the faithful come to be in their -- wheelchairs and crutches , and so on .
all these candles , so many thousands of candles people had lit in tribute to this .
anybody can do it , turns out .
but it got me thinking about the fact that these guys , at least most of them , know what it is that they do for a living .
they persisted . and Nathan went directly to the community .
and that what firemen do to train sometimes is they take a house that is going to be torn down , and they burn it down instead , and practice putting it out .
not because you force them to do something against their will , but because they wanted to connect .
thousands of people around the country who could give his presentation for him , because he can &apos;t be in 100 or 200 or 500 cities in each night .
now there is a million things I could share with you about the mechanics here .
he just stepped up and said , &quot; Fol@@ low me . &quot;
it can be something as prosaic as shoes , and something as complicated as over@@ throwing a government .
Michel@@ le K@@ au@@ f@@ man has pioneered new ways of thinking about environmental architecture .
they want to be missed .
as a result , parents resort to local solutions like tying hot water bottles around their babies &apos; bodies , or placing them under light bulbs like the ones you see here -- methods that are both ineffective and unsafe .
what you see here looks nothing like an incubator .
in designing this we followed a few basic principles .
my experience , however , in the Islamic world is very different .
and it &apos;s called &quot; The 99 . &quot;
these are some of the questions that are at the center of my exploration on the nature of erotic desire and its con@@ com@@ it@@ ant dilemmas in modern love .
we can experience that powerful thing called anticipation , which is a mor@@ tar to desire , the ability to imagine it , as if it &apos;s happening , to experience it as if it &apos;s happening , while nothing is happening and everything is happening at the same time .
it won &apos;t make a dent . there is nobody at the reception desk .
the instruments are loud enough that they can be heard without amplification , etc . , etc .
speaking at TED in 1998 , Rev@@ . Billy Graham marvels at technology &apos;s power to improve lives and change the world -- but says the end of evil , suffering and death will come only after the world accepts Christ . a legendary talk from TED &apos;s archives .
he said , &quot; Your ser@@ mons have certainly helped me . &quot;
and David found that there were many problems that technology could not solve .
I &apos;ve done a lot of speaking in Germany and in France , and in different parts of the world -- 105 countries it &apos;s been my privilege to speak in .
it was alive once , hunted , stolen , stretched .
our humming will be drumming .
are you holding her ?
one woman searches rubble . one woman feeds on trash .
Licklider was a computer science ti@@ tan who had a profound effect on the development of technology and the Internet .
Licklider intuitively realized this , contemplating humans setting the goals , form@@ ulating the hypotheses , determining the criteria , and performing the evaluation .
the major emphasis of most approaches to big data focus on , &quot; How do I store this data ? how do I search this data ? how do I process this data ? &quot;
so I stepped back from the workforce , and I spent a year at home with my wife and four young children .
a day is too short ; &quot; after I retire &quot; is too long .
it &apos;s totally dominated by work .
the area also has one of the lowest ratios of parks to people in the city .
these land-use decisions created the hostile conditions that lead to problems like obesity , diabetes and asthma .
the common perception was that only pim@@ ps and pu@@ shers and prostitutes were from the South Bronx .
little by little , we &apos;re seeding the area with green collar jobs -- then the people that have both a financial and personal stake in their environment .
so three things have happened .
I have a neighbor who knows 200 types of wine .
I &apos;m telling you that there are many dimensions of development .
we need everything .
and you might also know that , for science and medicine , Boston is a bit of a candy store .
you might know that , so far in just the dawn of this revolution , we know that there are perhaps 40,000 unique mutations affecting more than 10,000 genes , and that there are 500 of these genes that are bon@@ a-@@ fi@@ de drivers , causes of cancer .
and the very un@@ satisfying , yet scientific , answer is it &apos;s too hard .
that for whatever reason , these three proteins have entered a space in the language of our field that &apos;s called the un@@ dru@@ ggable genome -- which is like calling a computer un@@ surf@@ able or the Moon un@@ wal@@ kable .
this BRD@@ 4@@ -@@ addicted cancer was growing throughout his left lung , and he had a chest tube in that was draining little bits of debris .
it &apos;s not orally available .
what we do have is the flexibility of an academic center to work with competent , motivated , enthusiastic , hopefully well-@@ funded people to carry these molecules forward into the clinic while preserving our ability to share the prototype drug worldwide .
I &apos;ve often wondered , what is the evolutionary pressure that made our ancestors in the Vel@@ dt adapt and evolve to really enjoy pictures of galaxies when they didn &apos;t have any .
there &apos;s a finite region of space that we have access to , surrounded by a horizon .
remember , life itself depends on the arrow of time .
but there will also be large fluctuations .
Carl Sagan once famously said that &quot; in order to make an apple pie , you must first invent the universe . &quot;
you could be a random fluctuation out of the no@@ thing@@ ness .
I had never seen an airplane before .
we use gestures not only to interact with these objects , but we also use them to interact with each other .
and this small system actually prints it out -- so it actually acts like a paper in@@ pu@@ t-@@ output system , just made out of paper .
and , actually , if you see , there are some color markers that in the beginning version we are using with it .
but I &apos;m more excited that you can actually take it outside .
many of you already must have thought , OK , you can browse .
people agree that paintings or movies or music are beautiful because their cultures determine a uniformity of aesthetic taste .
so we say , are@@ a-@@ denial , anti-@@ access asymmetrical strategies and their eyes glaze over .
but here &apos;s the deal .
we should have had 250,000 troops streaming into Iraq on the heels of that Leviathan sweeping towards Baghdad .
here &apos;s my challenge to the Defense Department .
so they start moving from reality towards desire and they create their own special language to describe their voyage of self-@@ discovery and self-@@ actu@@ alization .
some people say 9 / 11 heals the rift -- jer@@ ks the long-term transformation gurus out of their 30,000 foot view of history , drags them down in to the muck and says , &quot; You want a networked opponent ?
last slide .
and in the summer of 2009 , we invited dozens of blind youth from all over the country and gave them a chance to take it for a spin .
but the problem with this car was it was designed to only be driven in a very controlled environment , in a flat , closed-@@ off parking lot -- even the lanes defined by red traffic cones .
and they would give the projects code names , you know , mostly from &quot; Star Wars , &quot; actually : things like C@@ 3@@ PO , Y@@ od@@ a , Luke .
the town was burned down ; it was in the middle of winter , and it was a very , very severe winter .
what they remember is , of course , the great triumph , that the Brits were beaten , and we won , and that the country was born .
and it &apos;s open to us to introduce a new way of doing that , and that &apos;s what I &apos;ll talk about for 10 minutes , or whatever the time remains .
otherwise , they would be at a temperature of minus 150 , which is certainly not favorable for developing life , at least of the kind we know .
so , the farmers go out at night with heavily armed je@@ eps , and shine the headlights , and anything that doesn &apos;t look like a sheep , you shoot .
and my father , in a low voice , muttering , &quot; I &apos;m just the youngest brother , there &apos;s nothing I can do .
so enter a group of out dy@@ kes , young women who love the old music that once spread across that region from Mac@@ edonia to Bosnia , from Ser@@ bia to Slo@@ ven@@ ia .
Layma and her sisters had had enough .
and they need allies from their communities .
I wrote those same kinds of letters that my mother had written me for strangers , and tucked them all throughout the city , dozens and dozens of them . I left them everywhere , in cafes and in libraries , at the U.N. , everywhere .
but what if it &apos;s not about efficiency this time ?
and actually this is just one example of a much larger phenomenon .
what we call today Islamic Law , and especially Islamic culture -- and there are many Islamic cultures actually ; the one in Saudi Arabia is much different from where I come from in Istanbul or Turkey .
the name of the book is &quot; Islam Without Extre@@ mes : a Muslim Case for Liberty . &quot;
and that &apos;s why actually in the 19th century the Ottoman Empire , which then covered the whole Middle East , made very important reforms -- reforms like giving Christians and Jews an equal citizenship status , accepting a constitution , accepting a representative parliament , advancing the idea of freedom of religion .
and in my book , I went into that question as well .
there &apos;s stromatolites down there -- the first living things to capture photosynthesis -- and it &apos;s the only place they still occur today .
but then 800,000 civilians were slaughtered in a matter of just a few months .
if there &apos;s no solution on the battlefield , three factors can account for the prevention of ethnic conflict and civil war , or for sustainable peace afterwards : leadership , diplomacy and institutional design .
a final example : Kosovo .
this is Benki .
and you can never replicate that performance twice .
but nonetheless , if you &apos;re a college kid and you have no money , believe me , this is better than trying to use your cellphone .
I &apos;m not plugging T-Mobile .
leave off the last &quot; e &quot; for savings .
Google : ... commis@@ sary department on Mc@@ Cl@@ ell@@ an Avenue , Monterey .
they put this teen@@ y-@@ we@@ eny little ad , about 10 characters long .
anyway , this service , C@@ all@@ wave , promises that it &apos;s all software -- nobody is listening to your messages .
can I do one more one-minute song ? thank you .
and he happened to tell me about a conference he &apos;d just returned from in Israel , where they were talking about a new type of gamma detector .
but you can understand why there may be forces in the brea@@ st-@@ imaging world who prefer the status quo .
marketing people have never been able to do that .
so the idea is to create an object able to force the air , and to be in contact at the right speed at the right place , in all the effective parts of the plant .
how much power do we have ?
that &apos;s the kind of power I feel in this room .
you &apos;re safe . it &apos;s fine .
I &apos;m going to find that out , and when I find that out , I &apos;m going to prevent a huge amount of damage that he could cause .
first , I want to explain how and why crack cocaine had such a profound influence on inner-city gangs .
it was something that -- it &apos;s just there were limits to how powerful and important you could be if you had to live at home with your mother .
he was such a freak -- and that cli@@ pboard probably saved his life , because they figured no other rival gang member would be coming up to shoot at them with a cli@@ pboard .
and they made them available to us .
which already , I think , fore@@ shadows the main result that I &apos;ve talked about , about what a crappy job it was being in the gang .
and so the death rate -- not to mention the rate of being arrested , sent to prison , being wounded -- the death rate in our sample was seven percent per person per year .
the first one , I want to set a world record in flying from a cliff with my wingsuit .
with such a big space , the problem is obviously that there is a discrepancy between what your body can embrace , and what the space , in that sense , is .
it doesn &apos;t really tell you what you &apos;re looking at .
I spoke about a new way of exploring the ocean , one that focuses on attracting animals instead of scaring them away .

I still have two minutes .
is the latest tower in London a gh@@ er@@ kin or a sausage or a sex tool ?
we keep our office almost like an archive of architectural biodiversity .
this is an aerial photo taken last summer .
and we discovered that by controlling the size of the holes , we could actually turn the entire facade into a gigantic , naturally ventilated , ra@@ ster@@ ized image .
I &apos;m not going to talk about &quot; The Ske@@ ptical Environ@@ ment@@ alist &quot; -- probably that &apos;s also a good choice .
it could be at one dollar ; it could be 1,000 dollars .
we &apos;d like to know these things .
this off@@ ends a lot of people , and that &apos;s probably one of the things where people will say I shouldn &apos;t come back , either .
it &apos;s not saying that it &apos;s not a big problem .
which is a little good , but not very much good .
there &apos;s been many other semin@@ ars and university students , and different things .
so of course , what you don &apos;t do properly yourself is never deemed done really .
he says that the conscious mind is this tiny rider on this giant elephant , the unconscious .
being close to the content -- that &apos;s the content really is close to my heart .
so they &apos;re spinning these tiny nano fibers of pure cellulose .
we could , for example , imagine growing a lamp , a chair , a car or maybe even a house .
many articles calculate : how long would it take for this worker to work in order to earn enough money to buy what he &apos;s making ?
together , they make up the largest migration in history , and it is globalization , this chain that begins in a Chinese farming village and ends with iPhones in our pockets and Ni@@ kes on our feet and Coach handbags on our arms that has changed the way these millions of people work and marry and live and think .
this region seen here for the first time in the Cassini image taken in 2005 . this is the south polar region , with the famous ti@@ ger-@@ stripe fractures crossing the south pole .
we &apos;re all different sizes and our companies the same .
Jacqueline Novogratz on escaping poverty
when I asked her if she feared anything , or whether she would miss anything from Mathare , she said , &quot; What would I fear that I haven &apos;t confronted already ?
you think I will miss the violence or the drugs ? the lack of privacy ?
so we created this genetic algorithm to try this out , we made a model in X@@ L of a multi-@@ surface reflector , and an amazing thing evolved , literally evolved , from trying a billion cycles , a billion different attempts , with a fitness function that defined how can you collect the most light , from the most angles , over a day , from the sun .
so someone came up with a very clever idea , to -- instead of heating the whole cylinder and cooling the whole cylinder , what about if you put a dis@@ plac@@ er inside -- a little thing that shut@@ tles the air back and forth .
so , in conclusion , I would say my journey has shown me that you can revisit old ideas in a new light , and sometimes ideas that have been discarded in the past can be practical now if you apply some new technology or new twists .
and at less than a five-year payback , all of a sudden this becomes very economic So you don &apos;t have to just want to have a feel@@ -@@ good attitude about energy to want to have one of these .
M@@ air@@ a Kal@@ man , the illustrated woman
and Rick and I were on our way to a party in the Bronx , and somebody said Bron@@ x@@ istan , and somebody said Ferr@@ eri@@ stan , and we came up with this New Yorker cover , which we were able to -- we didn &apos;t know what we were doing .
E.@@ B. White wrote us a number of rules , which can either paraly@@ ze you and make you loa@@ the him for the rest of time , or you can ignore them , which I do , or you can , I don &apos;t know what , you know , eat a sandwich .
impossible to begin . enough . no . begin with the hapless dodo . &quot;
and then I go and have some tea .
H@@ od Li@@ pson builds &quot; self-aware &quot; robots
so , where are the robots ?
but I want to show you a different approach , and this is this robot over here , which has four legs .
so what you &apos;re seeing here are a couple of machines -- a pattern of locomotion .
end result : only 15 states have been certified to be able to do mass distribution of vaccine and drugs in a pandemic .
nobody knows the chain of command .
should you take Tamiflu for a long period of time , well , one of the side effects is suicidal ide@@ ations .
how many masks do you need ?
LG : for a long time , researchers in emerging diseases were kind of dis@@ missive of the pandemic flu threat on the grounds that back in 1918 they didn &apos;t have antibiotics .
these epiphytes are mainly dominated by the mosses .
I &apos;ve also looked out on urban places like this and thought about people who are dis@@ associated from trees in their lives .
given the du@@ re@@ ss that we &apos;re feeling environmentally in these times , it is time for scientists to reach outward , and time for those outside of science to reach towards academia as well .
once upon a time , the world was a big , dysfunctional family .
the only difference was , their mistakes were in the secret filing cabinets .
it &apos;s really difficult . so we &apos;re still having to rely on illegitimate ways of getting information , through leaks .
so when the Guardian did this investigation about the Afghan War , you know , they can &apos;t walk into the Department of Defense and ask for all the information .
I learned two really important things that day .
but , the theory &apos;s relatively easy .
this picture was taken 300 feet deep , catching new species of fish .
and , the other component on a breathing loop is the carbon dioxide absorbent canister .
I think we have their attention .
and if you &apos;re a biologist and you know about sharks , and you want to assess , you know , how much jeopardy am I really in here , there &apos;s one question that sort of jumps to the forefront of your mind immediately which is -- Di@@ ver 1 : what kind of sharks ?
might it be the discovery of a distant civilization and our common cosmic origins that finally drives home the message of the bond among all humans ?
and SETI is a mirror -- a mirror that can show us ourselves from an extraordinary perspective , and can help to trivi@@ alize the differences among us .
in social aspect of his life he was just like a child , he was not at all mat@@ ured .
there is no other shortcut , no other way to really understand him .
and we intend to use those numbers to create demand pull , and flip the market .
and it turns out that these are quite remarkable for safety .
they &apos;ll pop it back on and fix the scratch later .
each one is formed by one fairly cheap die set , instead of four expensive ones for stam@@ ping steel .
so we have lots of options .
and we could even do an X Pri@@ ze-@@ style golden carrot that &apos;s worth stretching further for .
the same for GPS .
we banned those chemicals , and we replaced them , unknow@@ ingly , with other substances that , molecule per molecule , are a hundred times more potent as he@@ at-@@ tr@@ apping , greenhouse gases than carbon dioxide .
girl 1 : we have -- in the very beginning of the whole game , always we do this : we each have a piece of paper ; we write down our name , our age -- are we rich , very rich , not rich , poor , medium , wealthy , boy@@ friends , dogs , pets -- what else -- sisters , brothers , and all those .
I could get invited to that party any day if I wanted to .
rather , our response is conditioned on our beliefs , about what they really are , what they came from , what they &apos;re made of , what their hidden nature is .
so she &apos;s stunned that he &apos;s standing in a subway station .
and how you think about what you &apos;re experiencing , your beliefs about the essence of it , affect how it hurts .
this is a headline from the Daily Tele@@ graph in the U.K .
and here &apos;s another example .
and you can get license to bring your drug to market with only data showing that it &apos;s better than nothing , which is useless for a doctor like me trying to make a decision .
and so you &apos;re bound to make your new drug look better .
it means that we extended cooperation across national boundaries ; we made the world more cooperative .
you know in 1950 the typical ship carried 5,000 to 10,000 tons worth of goods .
today a container ship can carry 150,000 tons ; it can be manned with a smaller crew ; and unloaded faster than ever before .
and we can see the tragedy of Africa in the first few bars here .
now ideas have this amazing property .
as he who lights his candle at mine receives light without dar@@ kening me .
take yourself out of your shoes , put yourself into the shoes of another person . &quot;
here , I &apos;ll give you an example .
and the Chinese respond in a very ugly way .
and this word here , George Bush called this war a cru@@ sa@@ de .
if they won &apos;t submit , kill them .
and you &apos;re thinking , &quot; My God , these Christians are coming to kill us . &quot;
whatever it is , you can go so far .
two new kinds of whales have been discovered , along with two new ant@@ el@@ opes , dozens of monkey species and a new kind of elephant -- and even a distinct kind of gorilla .
I wish we will work together to help create the key tools that we need to inspire preservation of Earth &apos;s biodiversity .
and most of all , it can inspire a new generation of biologists to continue the quest that started , for me personally , 60 years ago : to search for life , to understand it and finally , above all , to preserve it .
and after begging and p@@ leading for Christmas , I got a second-@@ hand video camera , and I instantly started making my own animations on my own , and all throughout high school I made my own animations .
so the biggest moment for me , though , my most important job now is I am a dad myself , and I have two beautiful daughters , and my goal is to surround them by inspiration , by the books that are in every single room of our house to the mur@@ als I painted in their rooms to the moments for creativity where you find , in quiet times , by making faces on the pati@@ o to letting her sit in the very desk that I &apos;ve sat in for the past 20 years .
now , this is one model of how language comes to be : namely , it &apos;s legisl@@ ated by an academy .
hundreds of verbs can go both ways .
just to give you a few examples : &quot; ending a pregnancy &quot; versus &quot; killing a fetus ; &quot; &quot; a ball of cells &quot; versus &quot; an unborn child ; &quot; &quot; invading Iraq &quot; versus &quot; liberating Iraq ; &quot; &quot; re@@ distributing wealth &quot; versus &quot; confisc@@ ating earnings . &quot;
I thought that was really weird , as if the Dutch government sends emails to anyone .
I came this close to changing species at that moment .
and I said , that &apos;s what this is ; this is calcium carbonate .
this is San@@ dia National Labs .
to figure out the elegant recipes that would take the small subset of the periodic table , and create miracle materials like that cell , is the task of green chemistry .
this is a locust . there can be 80 million of them in a square kilometer , and yet they don &apos;t collide with one another .
in ensemble , that &apos;s what whole ecosystems do : they create more and more opportunities for life .
theory and empirical evidence Have already taught us .
my mom was a single mom who worked at the phone company during the day and sold T@@ up@@ per@@ ware at night so that I could have every opportunity possible .
and when I was applying to business school and felt certain I couldn &apos;t do it and nobody I knew had done it , I went to my aunt who survived years of beat@@ ings at the hand of her husband and escaped a marriage of abuse with only her dignity intact .
I would love to share with you a story .
his name was Lothar , Lothar Meggendorfer .
they were happy because the story survived , and that the world would keep on spinning .
and so , like many people , we start with a house on a lot , and I &apos;m going to show you a typical construction on the top and what we &apos;re doing on the bottom .
it takes some energy , but if you deconstruct it -- you take it all apart , you use the bits -- you can get some of that energy back .
and so the question is : how could we make that back ?
so this is Betty . she &apos;s a New Cal@@ edonian crow .
so she adapted .
it &apos;s pretty annoying for the fishermen .
and now , every crow within five kilometers is standing by a sidewalk , waiting to collect its lunch .
and as we heard yesterday , that &apos;s the Pandora &apos;s box that &apos;s getting human beings in trouble , and we &apos;re starting to see it with them .
we found out they &apos;re really smart , and we found out that they can teach each other .
mind you , there &apos;s 2@@ 16 million dollars &apos; worth of change lost every year , but I &apos;m not sure I can depend on that RO@@ I from crows .
instead , I think we should look a little bit larger .
now we have humans imitating robots .
I know it &apos;s Hispanic because she &apos;s speaking Spanish to her companion .
and I got this in the Maryland Cor@@ rec@@ tional Institute for Women .
I could hear it , but I dared not to move . I didn &apos;t move .
her face was bruised . she had a black eye .
&quot; OK . OK ? OK . OK .
and they had to sew me up and straigh@@ ten my nose out .
and we can lie about our age online , too , pretty easily .
sadly , he &apos;s anonymous . his name is not mentioned .
he took a look and said , &quot; Oh , you &apos;re tying them wrong . &quot;
and here &apos;s how to tell .
if you pull the strands at the base of the knot , you will see that the bow will orient itself down the long axis of the shoe .
but after a while , I just decided here to go all the way and put the paint back into the cans .
but of course , once you are that far , you &apos;re not really satisfied .
pm : that &apos;s Dimitri at his most competitive .
they &apos;re always getting stressed .
you &apos;re going to meet loads of cool , new friends .
and I love those revolutions , and I love the future that Milo brings .
so what you do is -- one of those people has not really acquired language yet .
let me take a poll . how many of you think there are more males in the world ?
so Bill Gates , as he was staring out at the audience , he said , &quot; If you &apos;re not fully utilizing half the resources in your country , there is no way you will get anywhere near the top 10 . &quot;
join the movement .
what this shows is that the rate of growth of our emissions is accelerating .
I &apos;ll tell you how big the lever is : the lever is that big .
that the CO2 problem , the climate problem that we &apos;ve heard about , is driving lots of things -- innovations in the energy technologies that will reduce emissions -- but also , I think , inevitably , it will drive us towards thinking about climate and weather control , whether we like it or not .
this is a nuclear waste storage and encapsul@@ ation facility at Han@@ ford site in Washington State , where there are over 1,@@ 900 stainless steel capsules containing nuclear waste submerged in water .
this one is almost humorous because it feels like I could just sni@@ p all of that conversation in one easy cut .
I traveled across the United States photographing men and women who had been wrong@@ fully convicted of crimes they did not commit , violent crimes .
photography offered the criminal justice system a tool that transformed innocent citizens into criminals , and the criminal justice system failed to recognize the limitations of relying on photographic identi@@ fications .
Larry Youn@@ g@@ blood served eight years of a 10 and half year sentence in Arizona for the abduc@@ tion and repeated so@@ dom@@ izing of a 10 year old boy at a carni@@ val .
now another way we try to increase our happiness is we medic@@ ate ourselves .
so the ultimate goal of psycho@@ analy@@ tic psychotherapy was really what Freud called ordinary misery .
so for example , we &apos;re born loving the taste of something sweet and reacting aver@@ sively to the taste of something bitter .
now in the animal world , there is only one way to increase status , and that &apos;s dominance .
one was a passion for rodents .
why would you choose rats ?
now how do we communicate with rats ?
is &quot; tering , &quot; which , et@@ y@@ mo@@ logically , refers to the smell of tar .
this is how it works , and really , this is a generic technology .
microscopy for 1,800 patients .
if you actually didn &apos;t realize that plants have sex , they have rampant , promis@@ cuous and really quite interesting and curious sex . really .
this is some pollen embedded in a cotton shirt , similar to the one that I &apos;m wearing now .
this is a horse chest@@ nut .
and if you look carefully , you can see that there &apos;s a black blush right there .
the second reason we really liked MRI is that there &apos;s no radiation .
what are the downstream consequences then , when female-pattern heart disease is not recognized ?
what has happened in the last 15 years with this work ?
and in fact , it probably won &apos;t .
and the &#91; horizontal &#93; axis is time .
what we &apos;d like to do is start understanding the interaction between these patterns and the language that my son is exposed to to see if we can predict how the structure of when words are heard affects when they &apos;re learned -- so in other words , the relationship between words and what they &apos;re about in the world .
Philip has been a close collaborator on all the visualizations you &apos;re seeing .
so a lot of people are following this person -- very influential -- and they have a propensity to talk about what &apos;s on TV .
DR : thank you .
light enters , hits the back of the retina , and is circulated , most of which is streamed to the very back of the brain , at the primary visual cortex .
in order to do what I do , you have to understand what causes waste in the building industry .
so I can show you an object you &apos;ve never seen before .
on the other end of the spectrum , we have a Di@@ ony@@ sian perspective , which is more given to the passions and intuition , tolerant of organic texture and human gesture .
so the way the Apoll@@ onian personality takes a picture , or hangs a picture , is they &apos;ll get out a transit and a laser level and a micr@@ ometer .
do the math . &quot;
the whole thing has the structural value of corn .
and what we need to do is reconnect with those really primal parts of ourselves and make some decisions and say , &quot; You know , I think I would like to put CDs across the wall there .
and I put them together , so that in each pair of country , one has twice the child mortality of the other . and this means that it &apos;s much bigger a difference than the uncertainty of the data .
because the chimpanzee would score half right if I gave them two bananas with Sri Lanka and Turkey . they would be right half of the cases .
&quot; well , that &apos;s long life and small family , and Third World is short life and large family . &quot;
sort of crystalline . so DNA had a structure , even though it owed it to probably different molecules carrying different sets of instructions .
he &apos;ll build a model , and then we &apos;re going to be scooped .
and so Bragg said , &quot; Buil@@ d models . &quot;
I went in and showed them a pairing I &apos;d done , and Jerry Don@@ o@@ h@@ ue -- he was a chemist -- he said , it &apos;s wrong .
RNA provides the information for protein .
and so DNA didn &apos;t become a useful molecule , and the lawyers didn &apos;t enter into the equation until 1973 , 20 years later , when Bo@@ yer and Cohen in San Francisco and Stanford came up with their method of re@@ combin@@ ant DNA , and Stanford patented it and made a lot of money .
and then , they learned how to read the letters for the code .
and yet , in the controls there were three .
the global perspective is that up to 30 percent of children in school have learning weaknesses that are not self-@@ correcting , but with appropriate treatment , they can be screened for and detected and corrected and avoid their academic failure .
if that some place else where it bulges is inside the biggest nerve in your body , your brain , you get a vascular migraine .
all consciousness is about communication .
the concept that they &apos;re working towards -- and they have working prototypes -- is that we placed it throughout the motor points of the body where they &apos;re needed .
in my coma , one of the presen@@ ces I sensed was someone I felt was a protector .
patent trolls have done more damage to the United States economy than any domestic or foreign terrorist organization in history every year .
we have major challenges , you can imagine , to finish this job , but as you &apos;ve also seen , it &apos;s doable , it has great secondary benefits , and polio eradication is a great buy .
that &apos;s what it costs to reach 500 million children .
Beverly &apos;s clearly one of them , and this little leopard , Legadema , is another , and she changed our lives .
but for us to get them , not only do we push ourselves , but we live by certain rules of engagement , which mean we can &apos;t interfere .
Beverly sits on the one side where all her camera gear is , and I &apos;m on the other side where my space is .
so it would seem the hardest , soli@@ dest , den@@ sest rock is really almost entirely empty space , broken only by tiny particles so widely spaced they shouldn &apos;t count .
in a desert plain in Tanzania , in the shadow of the volcano O@@ l Don@@ yo L@@ enga@@ i , there &apos;s a dune made of volcanic ash .
for example , in oceanography , a lexicon of dolphin language is actually being created by basically visualizing the son@@ ar beams that the dolphins emit .
and I understood that documentary photography has the ability to interpret events from their point of view .
and in fact , were so successful at this that it topped Twitter for two weeks .
he &apos;s at a technology conference in Florida .
it &apos;s actually surprisingly hard for me to see a Fi@@ jian feature film .
it &apos;s actually a place that we probably should be paying attention to at the moment .
and we forget that most of the time we &apos;re checking Boston Red So@@ x scores .
fortunately people are trying to figure out how to fix this .
that &apos;s what I &apos;m trying to do . I need your help .
well , along comes Benjamin Franklin , and he comes close to convul@@ sing himself with a bolt of electricity off the end of his kite .
and then in the 1950s , late 1950s , the so-called muscle relax@@ ants were developed by pharmac@@ ologists , and it got so that you could induce a complete convulsion , an electro@@ en@@ cephal@@ ographic convulsion -- you could see it on the brain waves -- without causing any convulsion in the body except a little bit of twit@@ ching of the toes .
NASA , for example , serves ther@@ mal@@ -@@ stabilized sweet@@ -and-@@ sour pork on its shuttle menu for its astronauts .
what is this ?
it wasn &apos;t that , so they &apos;re like , OK , let &apos;s look at television , so they looked at an episode of &quot; Lost . &quot;
and in Philadelphia , you have Philadelphia cheese@@ steak roll , which looks like an egg roll on the outside , but a cheese@@ steak on the inside .
and you see there , it gets re@@ integrated in tissue .
he was broke all of the time .
and then my father connected with Nelson Mandela &apos;s anti-@@ apartheid party .
and those heroes did not need an army behind them .
in fact , we &apos;re in a phase where transformative change is necessary , which opens the window for innovation , for new ideas and new paradigms .
30 or so scientists around the world gathered and asked a question for the first time , &quot; Do we have to put the planet into the the pot ? &quot;
but I wasn &apos;t into selling whiskey ; I was into selling ice .
I was more interested in the things in between , you know , because you can leave an enormous range for ambiguity there .
but if we look on other parts of our bodies where we don &apos;t directly interact with the environment -- our kidneys , our livers , our hearts -- there is no way to say , by just looking at these organs , where in the world they would come from .
this may also be surprising because the Neanderthals were never in China .
so the model we &apos;ve proposed to explain this is that when modern humans came out of Africa sometime after 100,000 years ago , they met Neanderthals .
Stanley McChrystal : listen , learn ... then lead
and you put on the T-@@ 10 parachute .
so you get in the aircraft , you &apos;re flying along , and at 20 minutes out , these jump@@ masters start giving you commands .
and of course , you &apos;re responding with all of these .
and that &apos;s to boost everybody &apos;s confidence , to show that you &apos;re not scared .
and then you hook up , and you hook up your static line .
it &apos;s not like that electronic abs machine where , 15 minutes a month , you get wa@@ shboard abs .
data-rich displays like maps of campaign contributions , or maps of the disappearing polar ice caps , allow us to better understand the context and the flow of processes that affect us all .
Earth Witness would take this further , linking what you see with what thousands or millions of other people see around the world .
at that point , I became a little more ambitious and decided to see what else could children do with a computer .
I tried a really hard one then .
who was Pyth@@ ag@@ oras , and what did he do ?
we could change everything .
Jacqueline Novogratz on patient capitalism
and it was really the beginning of my understanding the power of language , and how what we call people so often distances us from them , and makes them little .
it &apos;s gone from soci@@ alist Tanzania into capitalist Tanzania , and continued to flourish . it had about 1,000 employees when we first found it .
one , that people will pay different prices , but the overwhelming number of people will come forth at one dollar per net and make a decision to buy it .
and - - no problem , but , unfortunately , continuing with the scientific examination of this painting came out that Ra@@ fa@@ el did not paint the unicorn , did not paint the puppy dog , actually left the painting unfinished , so all this writing about the exotic symbol of the unicorn - - unfortunately , is not very reliable .
and we worked very closely with the whole thing being a team effort , and with wonderful results like that flight .
this one doesn &apos;t have the video in it , but you get a little feel from what it can do .
well , inspired by the sentences , I decided to wield the paintbrush .
well the next breakthrough came from studying hundreds of Tasmanian devil cancers from all around Tasmania .
we found that all of these cancers shared the same DNA .
and why is it so difficult initially ?
governments snatch short-term opportunities and , by the end of the conflict , the chickens have come home to ro@@ ost .
so we have to be disciplined and focus on things that are critical .
one advantage of that is that you can allocate money coher@@ ently .
and that ability to get others to want what you want , to get the outcomes you want without coercion or payment , is what I call soft power .
and if we &apos;re going to deal with these two great power shifts that I &apos;ve described , the power shift represented by transition among states , the power shift represented by diffusion of power away from all states , we &apos;re going to have to develop a new narrative of power in which we combine hard and soft power into strategies of smart power .
but as important as technology and infrastructure are , perhaps the human element is even more critical .
so some solutions to heat can provide for win-@@ win-@@ wins .
but there might be some changes in store that you might not imagine . for example , planes require more runway for takeoff because the heated , less dense air , provides for less lift .
but we can simply no longer rely on established norms .
and I &apos;d like to think of it as a 21st century wisdom table , really .
so this happened in 1978 , and I was teaching many years later , and a friend of mine introduced me to a young filmmaker .
I was creating a lesson for students on Africa .
JH : I get chills every time I see that .
he says , &quot; How many zeros in a trillion ? I &apos;ve got to calculate that right away . &quot;
and the game is won .
and they find out what is right their own way , their own selves .
if you have a battery , it costs five cents to make it .
this is a little straw , and what you do is you just ni@@ p two corners here , and this becomes like a baby crocodile &apos;s mouth .
how can architects build a new world of sustainable beauty ? by learning from nature . at TED@@ Sal@@ on in London , Michael P@@ aw@@ lyn describes three habits of nature that could transform architecture and society : radical resource efficiency , closed loops , and drawing energy from the sun .
and if we &apos;re to make progress with the sustainability revolution , I believe there are three really big changes we need to bring about .
and what you do is you put it together in three layers , you wel@@ d it around the edge , and then you inflate it .
and there &apos;s just about every element of the periodic table in seawater .
so I started off at a young age as a physicist using computers as tools .
so what happens when you put these things together ?
and , for example , Wolfram Alpha and Mathematica are actually now full of algorithms that we discovered by searching the computational universe .
perhaps there &apos;s even some quite simple rule , some simple program for our universe .
but in at least a large class of cases , one can think of the universe as being like some kind of network , which , when it gets big enough , behaves like continuous space in much the same way as having lots of molecules can behave like a continuous fluid .
one &apos;s got to build a structure that &apos;s probably at least as deep as existing physics .
stay here . I &apos;ve got a question .
they wear nice dresses , high-@@ he@@ eled shoes .
it &apos;s something that so many girls -- I &apos;m lucky , I never died -- but many die .
the village , the women , the men , everybody came together to support me to come to get an education .
I wanted to do something .
and the idea is a simple , simple idea , which is the fact that the consumer has moved from a state of anxiety to action .
we found a couple of really interesting things .
Z@@ yn@@ ga has risen on the consumer &apos;s desire to not want to be locked in to fix@@ ed-@@ cost .
each time , my grandmother would utter some words in Arabic , take a red apple and stab it with as many rose thor@@ ns as the number of war@@ ts she wanted to remove .
but if we have no connection whatsoever with the worlds beyond the one we take for granted , then we too run the risk of drying up inside .
we &apos;re all thought to have something very distinctive , if not peculiar .
that is &quot; When the World &apos;s on Fire , &quot; a very old melody , in this case performed by the Carter Family .
okay , so in other words , great artists steal , but not from me .
but that &apos;s not the prime candidate for life in the solar system .
well , there is .
this is actually a picture of the spectrum of the Sun .
but in West African music , the &quot; one &quot; is thought of as the end of the phrase , like the period at the end of a sentence .
my mother , out in the audience , she jumped up , &quot; Hall@@ elujah , Johnny &apos;s talking ! &quot;
and I decided that I was going to go to school . so I did .
we have a special program for you . &quot; they did .
and my father came out , he was so proud .
my dad came out again .
I put my banjo on and I walked all the way to the East Coast , put my foot in the Atlantic Ocean -- it was seven years and one day it took me to walk across the United States .
but I know I needed to .
and I know that a lot of times we find ourselves in this wonderful place where we &apos;ve gotten to , but there &apos;s another place for us to go .
six months later , the women &apos;s infants were offered cereal mixed with carrot juice , and their facial expressions were observed while they ate it .
what this means is that fetuses are effectively being taught by their mothers about what is safe and good to eat .
they &apos;re being introduced to the characteristic flavors and spices of their culture &apos;s cuisine even before birth .
at 8 : 46 a.m. on September 11th , 2001 , there were tens of thousands of people in the vicinity of the World Trade Center in New York -- commu@@ ters spilling off trains , waitre@@ sses setting tables for the morning rush , bro@@ kers already working the phones on Wall Street .
but there &apos;s another way of thinking about PTSD .
imagining a solo cello concert , one would most likely think of Johan@@ n Sebastian Bach un@@ accompanied cello su@@ ites .
now , this requires another piece of hardware , which is this infrared pen .
there is nothing bigger or older than the universe .
and it can also turn into a commodity , which is a very scary thing .
he was talking about strong , smart , hardworking entrepreneurs who woke up every day and were doing things to make their lives and their family &apos;s lives better .
the second year , it was a total of 15 million .
imagine how you feel when you see somebody on street who is begging and you &apos;re about to approach them .
so what I think I can do today , that best thing I can give you -- I &apos;ve given you my story , which is the best I can do .
you don &apos;t need to remember that .
because it &apos;s only when you do that , that you can talk about -- -- it &apos;s only when you do that , &#91; that &#93; you can talk about how we looked like and how we behaved at different times , and how those likes and looks and behaviors changed through time .
and you see that in humans , because of the development of the pre-frontal cortex , it &apos;s called .
it &apos;s , in a way , your voice box .
Dr. Edith Widder -- she &apos;s now at the Ocean Research and Conservation Association -- was able to come up with a camera that could capture some of these incredible animals , and that &apos;s what you &apos;re seeing here on the screen .
well , as I said , we had a group of photographers that went out on board ships and actually photographed the activities in process .
so I &apos;m looking optimistically at our opportunities for creating a true , blue perspective for this beautiful planet .
we need to change how we actually go about managing these resources .
and third is that we need to look at ocean-basin-wide management .
and it all started one day on a plane , on my way to TED , seven years ago .
I figured , they &apos;re not work@@ a@@ ho@@ lics . they &apos;re work@@ a@@ fro@@ lics .
because that &apos;s the way people really get rich . &quot;
and there &apos;s no magic to creativity in coming up with ideas -- it &apos;s just doing some very simple things .
and I think that &apos;s going to create some incredibly intriguing opportunities for technologists .
and then he goes back to his quarters , breaks down and wee@@ ps because he &apos;s convinced that the situation is hopeless .
five thousand products -- that &apos;s still nothing .
but the way we solve them is with humility -- to abandon the God complex and to actually use a problem-solving technique that works .
you create 10 variations on that one .
we have no idea why it works , no idea at all .
and the reason he would do that kind of thing is because he understood it feels so much better to stand there and say , &quot; Here in my own little world , I am a god , I understand everything .
and he thought about it , and the expensive one didn &apos;t seem that great to him . so he thought , &quot; I don &apos;t know anything about science , but I do know something about data , so maybe I should go and look at the data and see whether this expensive and complicated treatment actually works any better than the cheap and simple one . &quot;
and people were very angry , and they called him horrible names .
and the line of argument , if you ask parents , is , &quot; But car seats are so expensive and complicated , and they have this big tangle of lat@@ ches , how could they possibly not work better than seatbelts because they are so expensive and complicated ? &quot;
and these , to me , are the analogy for the car seats .
I think I can safely say that I &apos;m the only trilli@@ onaire in this room .
life happens .
and so I began thinking more about other kinds of dimensions , and I made a quick list . was it Chris Jordan , the photographer , talking about numbers being so large that they &apos;re meaningless ?
I have three kind of general things I would like to say , three consequences of this .
Google . I can &apos;t remember my phone number , I &apos;ll just ask Google .
and so in the same way , we &apos;re going to not imagine ourselves without this other machine being there .
so we are the Web , that &apos;s what this thing is .
it demands some sort of notion of inquiry because it &apos;s a system that &apos;s developed not sculp@@ turally .
I started going out on cases .
and so I decided to write a book , a memoir , about this decade of my life .
but it &apos;s a technology so pervasive , so invisible , that we , for a long time , forgot to take it into account when we talked about human evolution .
this technology affected two organs , the brain and the gut , which it actually affected .
it &apos;s this brain which makes this reflex .
it can replace , or it can inhibit actually , signals .
so what we have actually , it &apos;s not an omni@@ v@@ ore &apos;s dilemma .
it &apos;s kind of like an An@@ dean Woo@@ d@@ stock : 60,000 Indians on pilgrimage to the end of a dirt road that leads to the sacred valley , called the Sin@@ ak@@ ara , which is dominated by three ton@@ gues of the great glacier .
and this gets us back to the mushrooms .
it &apos;s a waste product .
because the manufacturing process is our organism .
and it &apos;s a wonderful setting , as I hope you &apos;ll find , and a great icon to the best of the Victorian tradition .
that &apos;s a rather trivial connection between probability and genetics .
an intelligent receptacle prevents injuries because the power is always off , until an intelligent plug is detected . simple .
now if you had to pick a sense to lose , I have to be very honest with you and say , we &apos;re better at restoring hearing than we are at restoring any sense that there is .
I mentioned earlier the fact that music is a different capacity because it &apos;s abstract .
so if we had to design a perfect cochlear implant , what we would try to do is target it to be able to allow music transmission .
cochlear implant users cannot tell the difference between these instruments .
and so there is certainly a lot of hope , but there &apos;s a lot more that needs to be done .
raise your right hand . OK . how many of you don &apos;t know what I &apos;m talking about ? raise your left hand .
I chose the gun .
most regions of the world are moving in that direction .
but we do have the potential to overcome disease and poverty , and I &apos;m going to talk about those issues , if we have the will .
information technologies double their capacity , price performance , bandwidth , every year .
but Moore &apos;s Law , which is very often identified with this exponential growth , is just one example of many , because it &apos;s basically a property of the evolutionary process of technology .
in terms of price performance , that &apos;s a 40 to 50 percent deflation rate .
one little software program , called the fat insulin receptor gene , basically says , &quot; Hold onto every calorie , because the next hunting season may not work out so well . &quot;
there &apos;s actually a -- for the first time now , something going to human trials , that actually cures pulmonary hypertension -- a fatal disease -- using gene therapy .
but if we go to 20@@ 29 , we really have the full maturity of these trends , and you have to appreciate how many turns of the screw in terms of generations of technology , which are getting faster and faster , we &apos;ll have at that point .
and information technology is increasingly encompassing all of our lives , from our music to our manufacturing to our biology to our energy to materials .
this climber is on the last pitch of it .
it &apos;s like a water dow@@ sing device .
your next decision could be the most important one of your life .
Bru@@ gger and his colleague , Christine Mohr , gave subjects L-@@ DO@@ PA .
they increase the amount of dopamine .
it &apos;s a distinction perhaps we might make between two Nobel laureates , Richard Feynman and John N@@ ash .
help WITNESS give cameras to the world .
and then you have to have the skills that it takes to get a company going .
basically none .
I know the day , I know who I am , I know you &apos;re presenting .
and then you want to give me a quick business overview .
we need a revolution because things aren &apos;t working ; they &apos;re just not working .
social : 45 years of what ?
true story : I went looking for a school for my kid .
nature isn &apos;t stupid , and it selected for play .
rats play , but what you might not have known is that rats that play more have bigger brains and they learn tasks better , skills .
the more you play , the bigger the brains there are .
we develop better decision-making ability if we play more .
we had marginal profits , and we had unhappy stakeholders .
I don &apos;t care if it &apos;s mountain biking or reading a book or playing a game .
the guil@@ d system : that means when I was an apprentice , I had to apprentice myself in order to become a pottery master .
and there I was sitting , and my then-@@ boyfriend -- I didn &apos;t mean it was a boyfriend like it is meant today -- but my boyfriend and I sat at the market and sold the pots .
after I brushed them off with a hand motion , they were very -- I finally was now accepted , and worked there for some six months .
I remember vividly , sitting there in the hospital .
and we obviously went forward . we did .
so I &apos;m going to do this for you right now , what you just heard .
and it &apos;s a dummy head that sits in front of the instrument , and it &apos;s got microphones where the ears are .
when times are hard , people have to do things for themselves , and right across the world , Oxford , O@@ ma@@ ha , O@@ m@@ sk , you can see an extraordinary explosion of urban farming , people taking over land , taking over roofs , turning bar@@ ges into temporary farms .
some , I think some of the bankers who have appear to have learned nothing and forgotten nothing .
and his life was a systematic experiment to find better social answers , not from a theory , but from experiment , and experiment involving the people with the best intelligence on social needs , which were usually the people living with those needs .
it &apos;s what we do in the organization named after him where we try and invent , create , launch new ventures , whether it &apos;s schools , web companies , health organizations and so on .
and they &apos;ve been given new momentum by the crisis , by the need for better answers to job@@ lessness , community breakdown and so on .
it feeds the English requirement .
it &apos;s an Arabic medium school .
let &apos;s have the next slide .
so this just summarizes it . &quot; over billions of years , on a unique sphere , chance has painted a thin covering of life -- complex and probable , wonderful and fragile .
consumption , in that sense , is an expression of their productive potential .
over here , let &apos;s imagine we &apos;ve got Wikipedia , Linux , and beyond -- open source .
and those organizational models , it turns out , are incredibly powerful , and the people who can understand them will be very , very successful .
and the man said , &quot; Really ? &quot; and he showed him a dish full of needles .
again , no vision of Maitreya after nine years .
so that encouraged him , and he went with Maitreya .
Maitreya then took him to a certain heaven , which is the typical way a Buddhist myth unfolds .
you gave me that expression ; &quot; the eternal mama , &quot; you said . that &apos;s wonderful .
and we don &apos;t hate anyone , therefore . so we equ@@ alize . that &apos;s very important .
and so you see beings in their potential happiness .
but actually they are cruel to themselves .
and materialism , they think they get out of it just by not existing , by dying , but they don &apos;t .
and that means whatever happens to other beings is happening to us : we are responsible for that , and we should take it and do whatever we can at whatever little level and small level that we can do it .
and that un@@ compassionate clock has just showed me that it &apos;s all over .
a second argument would be : because it was sitting on a stove with the flame on -- that &apos;s an historical argument .
so , for example , stones .
it &apos;s a little paper chip .
and people started laying bread in tribute , and eventually a team was able to do it between New Zealand and Spain .
you can look at it online .
and I shut that part down .
now the only person -- it turns out one son and one daughter , siblings , didn &apos;t get along and their patterns are exactly the same .
it &apos;s 27 kilometers in circum@@ ference .
and we re-@@ create the conditions that were present less than a billionth of a second after the universe began up to 600 million times a second inside that detector -- immense numbers .
but you don &apos;t feel them , because the weak force is correctly named -- very short range and very weak , so they just fly through you .
right , H .
H stands for Higgs particle .
so that &apos;s one thing .
by measuring their student smiles , researchers were able to predict how fulfilling and long-lasting a subject &apos;s marriage will be , how well she would score on standardized tests of well-being and how inspiring she would be to others .
because I really believe that we &apos;re never more beautiful than when we &apos;re most ugly .
I don &apos;t really see it , I don &apos;t pay attention to it until there &apos;s , you know , like a bug that &apos;s dead on the window .
and , &quot; Do you notice any dis@@ charges ? &quot;
it doesn &apos;t require a tremendous thing .
so this gets a little challenging because the dynamics of this robot are quite complicated .
and so what the robot does is it plans what we call a minimum snap trajectory .
so as an academic , we &apos;re always trained to be able to jump through ho@@ ops to raise funding for our labs , and we get our robots to do that .
they &apos;re maintaining formation .
unless you &apos;re on one of these Califor@@ nian low-@@ car@@ b diets , bread is standard .
who pre@@ fers the whole-@@ meal bread ?
in the 10,000 years since agriculture evolved , most of our ancestors have actually been agricul@@ tur@@ alists or they were closely related to food production .
of course , the reality is quite different .
with the advent of the Industrial Revolution with modernization of agriculture in the last few decades , since the 1960s , food availability , per head , in this world , has increased by 25 percent .
but this is now this strange concoction of high calories .
and the fallacy comes from ide@@ alizing a past that we have forgotten about .
that need for animal protein is going to continue .
and never before have we had the luxury of taking it for granted because it is now so cheap .
I studied yoga for many years with a teacher named Sw@@ ami S@@ at@@ ch@@ id@@ an@@ anda and people would say , &quot; What are you , a Hindu ? &quot; he &apos;d say , &quot; No , I &apos;m an undo . &quot;
and the insurance companies found that they began to save almost 30,000 dollars per patient , and Medicare is now in the middle of doing a demonstration project where they &apos;re paying for 1,800 people to go through the program on the sites that we train .
it &apos;s not so much psychological , it &apos;s vascular , and nicotine makes your arteries con@@ strict .
now , one of the studies funded by the Atkins Center found that 70 percent of the people were con@@ stip@@ ated , 65 percent had bad breath , 54 percent had headaches - this is not a healthy way to eat .
now , there are ecological reasons for eating lower on the food chain too , whether it &apos;s the deforestation of the Amazon , or making more protein available , to the four billion people who live on a dollar a day -- not to mention whatever ethical concerns people have .
five years later , those women lived twice as long , and you can see that the people -- and that was the only difference between the groups .
it really changed my life totally .
and it actually crawled into somebody &apos;s bathroom , and was hanging around there for two or three days .
but it &apos;s possibly , and definitely not enough .
so , we &apos;re not sure where this story is going to end , whether it &apos;s got a happy or sad ending .
and it &apos;s a bleak future for them .
the corpor@@ ates , the artists , the wildlife nuts , the good old everyday folks can actually bring these rivers back .
Ed Ul@@ br@@ ich : how Benjamin Button got his face
and now what we &apos;re looking at is really creating a surface capture as opposed to a marker capture .
so these are the gentleman who played Benjamin .
so , effectively we created a digital puppet that Brad Pitt could operate with his own face .
take another look .
and we found this right in this very state , in Karnataka .
now , when we started working deeper and digging deeper , we found that it &apos;s an illegal act .
and now he sells cool drinks , he &apos;s by the highway .
and then it started , there was no turning back after that .
we were able to ensure brighter futures for these people .
of course we also had to get the bears in .
and the children , both humans and bear cubs can live peacefully . thank you .
about every 10 steps , they lean back and try to take a chunk out of your leg .
Hello . this is Keith Bel@@ lows with the National Geographic Ca@@ mel In@@ vesti@@ gation Un@@ it .
don &apos;t even think about it . don &apos;t think about it !
C@@ all@@ ouses on my knees that let me kne@@ el comfortably .
short fur that keeps my skin cool .
BC : thank you .
Derek Sivers : how to start a movement
first , of course you know , a leader needs the guts to stand out and be ridiculed .
the biggest lesson , if you noticed -- did you catch it ? -- is that leadership is over-@@ glorified .
and I &apos;ve done this in three parts .
so they think it &apos;s actually very deadly .
so that is it .
in fact , this is exactly the kind of question we &apos;re faced with when we try to understand the Indus Valley civilization , which existed 4,000 years ago .
it occupied the area of approximately one million square kilometers , covering what is now Pakistan , Nor@@ thwestern India and parts of Afghanistan and Iran .
you might wonder what these objects contain in terms of their text .
I &apos;ll give you a couple of seconds .
and the Indus script now has this particular property .
given the computer model , we can test the model by essentially quiz@@ zing it .
linguistic scripts occupy the middle range .
I even started to get some hate mail .
my students said that I should really seriously consider getting some protection .
it shows that the Indus script shares an important property of language .
so for example the first text : there &apos;s a doubling of this j@@ ar-@@ shaped sign .
this suggests that the same script , the Indus script , could be used to write different languages .
in the case of the Indus script , the problem is the reverse .
I can &apos;t wait to find out .
too bad nobody ever woke up to it , and they &apos;ve been trying to suppress it since then .
look at that beautiful thing Chi@@ ho showed us . she scared us with the lava man .
so the first person who gets happy , when you stop focusing on the self-@@ centered situation of , how happy am I , where you &apos;re always dissatisfied -- as M@@ ick Jagger told us . you never get any satisfaction that way .
it was a solar wind interacting with our ion@@ osphere that he was listening to -- a phenomena which we can see at the extreme northern and southern latitudes of our planet as the aur@@ ora .
now this didn &apos;t make any sense , and like any reasonable engineer or scientist , they assumed that the problem must be the technology itself , it must be the dish .
how do you do this ?
they can locom@@ ote on substr@@ ates that vary as you saw -- in the probability of contact , the movement of that surface and the type of fo@@ oth@@ olds that are present .
journalists , this is off the record ; it &apos;s embar@@ go@@ ed .
extraordinary . no sensing , all the control is built right into the tuned legs .
it couldn &apos;t do that before ; it would just slip and get stuck and tip over .
we can actually model that behavior better as a fluid , if you look at it .
can you use this to make a better robot ?
now you might think for smooth surfaces we get inspiration here .
and here are Ri@@ SE &apos;s first steps on an incline .
but we think we got the dynamics right of the robot .
so these are tuned toes -- there are six of them , and they use the principles that I just talked about collectively for the blueprint .
here you see it , next , going up the side of a building at Stanford .
they can produce loud clicks and listen for echoes from the sea floor in order to orient .
the top plot here shows a complicated series of calls that are repeated by males .
humpbacks , when they develop the ability to sing this song , they &apos;re listening to other whales and modifying what they sing based on what they &apos;re hearing , just like song birds or the dolphin whistles I described .
so the effect , very quickly , is it &apos;s a new kind of arousal .
now , the great thing about mapping applications -- it &apos;s not really 2D , it &apos;s kind of 3D . so , again , with a multi-@@ point interface , you can do a gesture like this -- so you can be able to tilt around like that , you know . it &apos;s not just simply relegated to a kind of 2D pan@@ ning and motion .
and when I close it , it becomes a character .
in this passionate talk from TEDx@@ San@@ Mi@@ gu@@ el@@ de@@ Allende that &apos;s already caused a sensation in Mexico , Emi@@ li@@ ano Salinas , son of former president Carlos Salinas de Gor@@ tari , confron@@ ts the current climate of violence in Mexico -- or rather , how Mexican society responds to it . he calls on ordinary citizens to move from denial and fear to peaceful , community-@@ based action . this is the first talk posted on TED@@ .com that was delivered in a language other than English .
I grew up in a traditional Mexican family .
it will also make members of criminal organizations nervous for the same reasons .
we are a country of victims .
and now of the Z@@ etas and the traffickers and the criminals and the kid@@ nap@@ pers ...
we need to open our eyes and see that we are not victims .
they sent a message to the kid@@ nap@@ pers : &quot; if you want your ransom come and get it .
that devotion we feel for the national football team .
well , a lot of people think jugglers defy gravity or do stuff .
so , complexity . now , how many here are jugglers ?
OK ? and whoever laughed there -- you understood it completely , right ?
balance : making up the rules so you can &apos;t cheat , so you learn to approach stil@@ lness with different parts of your body .
and so in order to do that we &apos;ve been forming internal video-@@ production groups in order to make these kind of experience prototypes that show just what we mean about the man-@@ machine relationship .
so we thought , well , wouldn &apos;t it be fun to get together with some of the smartest design guys in the world and try to figure out if we could make the cubicle better ?
we &apos;ll see what happens .
so you feel that in your cubicle .
it &apos;s called Sp@@ yfish , and it &apos;s a company called H@@ 2@@ Eye , started by Nigel Jagger in London .
and the other one was to design the object and make sure that it was a consumer product and not a research tool .
what they do now is : they can grow crops in the rainy season but they can &apos;t grow them in the off-season .
this is extraordinary . because rice -- get this -- rice is known to have 38 thousand genes .
now again , we kind of ca@@ ved in , and we did the very practical approach , which was a bit less awesome .
that gives us a time series of how frequently this particular sentence was used over time .
we do that for all the words and phrases that appear in those books , and that gives us a big table of two billion lines that tell us about the way culture has been changing .
what should I do ? &quot;
and the story of 1950 is the story of every year that we have on record , with a little twist , because now we &apos;ve got these nice charts .
so for those of you who seek to be famous , we can learn from the 25 most famous political figures , authors , actors and so on .
but then also many people on the far right who seem to benefit from propaganda .
but it turns out in the 18th century , people didn &apos;t really care about that at all .
so I &apos;d like to share with you five simple exercises , tools you can take away with you , to improve your own conscious listening .
and I said , I want to do this for four years , make some money , like I was having a family , and I would mature a bit , and maybe the business of neuroscience would mature a bit .
well , I just told you there &apos;s so much data coming out your ears .
we have so much information , we don &apos;t even know how to begin to organize it .
and I &apos;m going to work you through this in a few slides here , give you an example of what this means . here &apos;s a system .
they say , well , we have a thing in a box , and we have its inputs and its outputs .
and on top of it , we have this memory system called the neocortex .
mom , I &apos;m really trying .
and if each of us who cares about the different things we care about got up off our but@@ ts and volunteered as much time as we could , we would change this world , we would save this world .
she was mesmer@@ ized .
I can &apos;t even name them all .
because it remains hard work for women to wash .
it &apos;s a hard , time-consuming labor , which they have to do for hours every week .
lexicography : the practice of compiling dictionaries .
there &apos;s not a lot of clic@@ kiness .
how can this be ? I mean , I love books . I really love books .
see , I just gave you a lot of words and a lot of numbers , and this is more of a visual explanation .
we &apos;re social animals , not rational animals .
they are able to adjust strength of the conclusions to the strength of their evidence .
I don &apos;t remember the rape part of it so much as much as the anger part of it .
some pay the price for it .
and it &apos;s abnormal to live in a shelter .
it &apos;s abnormal to get rehabilit@@ ated .
understanding my own self , understanding my own pain , my own isolation , was my greatest teacher .
why wel@@ ding and why not computers ?
my challenge has not been the traffickers who beat me up .
that &apos;s my biggest challenge .
two years ago at TED , I think -- I &apos;ve come to this conclusion -- I think I may have been suffering from a strange delusion .
and worse than that , far worse than that , my sense of self-worth was kind of evaporating .
well , in the end , we were able to save Future and S@@ now@@ ball , but I was , at that point , ready to move on .
but something as basic as happiness , which 20 years ago would have been just something for discussion in the church or mosque or synagogue , today it turns out that there &apos;s dozens of TED@@ -like questions that you can ask about it , which are really interesting .
and as I grew up , it became worse and worse , And I started to think of it as a form of control .
and so this object is constantly expanding and contracting to create a dynamic with people moving around it -- almost like it were trying to conceal a secret within its seams or something .
so , in favor of the proposition , possibly shockingly , is one of , truly , the founders of the environmental movement , a long-standing TEDster , the founder of the Whole Earth Catalog , someone we all know and love , Stewart Brand .
so the difference is the opportunity cost of using nuclear versus wind , or something else .
and we can guarantee a clean , blue sky or an uncertain future with nuclear power .
in every case , they got the weapons before they got the nuclear power .
Alex : Hi , I &apos;m Alex . I just wanted to say , I &apos;m , first of all , renewable energy &apos;s biggest fan .
so if we want to keep the lights on , we actually need a solution which is going to keep generating all of the time .
and people left their jobs and they went to obscure locations to go and be part of this amazing mission .
the shuttle is costing a billion dollars a launch .
Peter Diamandis : probably the most difficult thing that I had to do was raise the capital for this . it was literally impossible .
see , the insurance companies went to Boeing and Lock@@ heed , and said , &quot; Are you going to compete ? &quot; no .
&quot; are you going to compete ? &quot; no . &quot; no one &apos;s going to win this thing . &quot;
Or@@ te@@ ig didn &apos;t pay a dime out to the nine teams that went across -- tried to go across the Atlantic , and we didn &apos;t pay a dime until someone won the Ansari X PRIZE .
we can fold a million times faster , we can fold in hundreds and hundreds of variations .
I designed the process that generated the form .
well it looked like a little shanty shed when I &apos;d finished .
but I thought , perhaps the ant won &apos;t know , it &apos;ll probably move in .
and then he said , &quot; But I don &apos;t believe that you can do this . &quot; so I said , &quot; OK . &quot;
so I was crushing up these pieces of glass , which , as you can see , that &apos;s the actual frame of the house .
and I had to make them square .
right . as you can see , Bart Simpson is having a little argument .
audience : no .
because it &apos;s on this molecular level things change and they act different .
so I broke the needle .
it &apos;s -- I had to make little holes in the base of the needle , to shove his feet in .
we have realized that recently more and more people are using the means of YouTube and social networking to express their stories , share their photos and tell their own stories through their own voices .
&quot; and , &quot; God says , &quot; my servant continues to get near@@ er to me , by doing more of what I &apos;ve asked them to do &quot; -- extra credit , we might call it -- &quot; until I love him or love her .
and it &apos;s apparently okay to marry a boy from Georgia , but not to have hair from Texas .
and as he talked he had that gl@@ int in his eye that I first saw back in Holland -- the gl@@ int that says , &quot; Let &apos;s go cow tipping , &quot; even though we never did tip the cow , even though no one tips the cow , even though cows don &apos;t sleep standing up .
and if you did see the Sanjay special , you saw these enormous scre@@ ws that they screwed into my pelvis .
and what he actually did was he de-@@ vascularized it from my calf and re-@@ vascularized it in my thigh and then connected it to the good parts of my knee and my hip .
someone asked me if he cried when I asked him to be in the council of dads .
and that is , the secret of the Council of Dads , is that my wife and I did this in an attempt to help our daughters , but it really changed us .
and the epidemiologists here will tell you , that &apos;s half the number of people who get the disease in one year in the United States .
and so , coming directly from there to here .
too often we just see a few slides , or a bit of film , but these beings have voices that mean something .
I &apos;ve been studying chimpanzees in Tanzania since 1960 .
we &apos;re in every state now , and the problems in Florida are different from the problems in New York .
Chris Anderson : one -- one to two .
and I believe that a group like this can have a very major impact , not just because you can share technology with us , but because so many of you have children .
so some things that are missing is , for example , if you had a flow of energy through a system , what we &apos;d want is a protocell that can harvest some of that energy in order to maintain itself , much like living systems do .
so , I added these protocells together to the system , and protocell A and protocell B fused together to form a hybrid protocell AB .
most of these don &apos;t contain DNA , but yet they have lifelike properties .
and I would use this study , a recent study by Philip L@@ and@@ ri@@ gan , to motivate a different view of health , where he went to most of the pediatr@@ icians in Manhattan and the New York area and logged what they spent their patient hours on .
this is one of the more ambitious ones .
displacement is not the way to deal with environmental issues .
general Motors ve@@ ep Larry Burns previews cool next-@@ gen car design : sleek , custom@@ izable vehicles that run clean on hydrogen -- and pump energy back into the electrical grid when they &apos;re idle .
what we &apos;ve targeted for ourselves -- and we &apos;re making great progress for this goal -- is to have a propulsion system based on hydrogen and fuel cells , designed and validated , that can go head@@ -to-@@ head with the internal combustion engine -- we &apos;re talking about obsole@@ ting the internal combustion engine -- and do it in terms of its affordability , add skill volumes , its performance and its dur@@ ability .
cities , past and future .
or , in the words of F. Scott Fitz@@ gerald , &quot; As the moon rose higher , the in@@ essential houses began to melt away until gradually I became aware of the old island here that once flo@@ wered for Dutch sailors &apos; eyes , a fresh green breast of the new world . &quot;
and so when it became time for me to do my graduate studies , I studied this emerging field of landscape ecology .
for those of you who are from New York , this is 12@@ 5th street under the West Side Highway .
and , you know , built the society that we now live in .
so you have density . you also have growth management .
there &apos;s also neo-@@ biological design , where more and more we &apos;re actually using life itself and the processes of life to become part of our industry .
you get -- this is a building in Hyderabad , India .
and the same thing is true for people who are in absolute crisis . right ?
just to wrap up , in the immortal words of H@@ .@@ G. Wells , I think that better things are on the way .
but it turns out to be illegal to print a child &apos;s drawing of M@@ icky Mouse onto a plate of sugar .
if you want a printed sugar birthday cake , you have to use one of our pre@@ fab images -- only for professionals . &quot;
now the reason it won &apos;t work is that you can still type 7@@ 4.@@ 12@@ 5.@@ 2@@ 26@@ .@@ 2@@ 12 into the browser or you can make it a clic@@ kable link and you &apos;ll still go to Google .
every DVD player and game player and television and computer you brought home -- no matter what you thought you were getting when you bought it -- could be broken by the content industries , if they wanted to set that as a condition of selling you the content .
and if you &apos;re not an American citizen , you can contact American citizens that you know and encourage them to do the same .
I went to a very elitist , sno@@ bb@@ ish , expensive education in India , and that almost destroyed me .
&quot; you didn &apos;t get a government job ? &quot; I said , &quot; No . &quot;
this is waterproofing the roof . &quot;
because it &apos;s for the convenience of the child ; it &apos;s not for the convenience of the teacher .
and she thought for a minute and said , &quot; It &apos;s the first time I can see my husband &apos;s face in winter . &quot;
the brain now a world that we can fly through and interact with .
we &apos;ve taken this information and we &apos;ve made a mathematical model out of it .
it &apos;s up there with opposable thumbs and standing upright and language as one of the things that got our species out of the trees and into the shopping mall .
from field studies to laboratory studies , we see that winning or losing an election , gaining or losing a romantic partner , getting or not getting a promotion , passing or not passing a college test , on and on , have far less impact , less intensity and much less duration than people expect them to have .
we synthesize happiness , but we think happiness is a thing to be found .
as a challenge to myself , since I say this once in a while in lectures , I took a copy of the New York Times and tried to find some instances of people synthesizing happiness .
I mean , you go out on a date with a guy , and he picks his nose ; you don &apos;t go out on another date .
it &apos;s a very small increase , and it doesn &apos;t much matter whether they were in the reversible or irreversible condition .
he grew up in a bo@@ hio of dirt floors , and the structure was the kind used by the T@@ ain@@ os , our old Ara@@ wa@@ k ancestors .
I was born in 19 -- I forget , and I came to this country with them in the aftermath of the Cuban revolution .
it was a Saturday morning .
&quot; would this guy have , like , a blue uniform and a terrified look on his face ? &quot;
correct the other direction now , it &apos;s OK .
she looks at me like I &apos;m her , you know , her moron child , the cre@@ tin , the one she &apos;s got to speak to very slowly and distinctly .
secret of the trade .
it means that I pay only for what I need .
all those hours when a car is sitting idle , I &apos;m not paying for it .
I &apos;m going to give you some examples .
they mesh-@@ enabled 300 buses and they speak to these smart termin@@ als .
you can smell bakery air , walk around with rain hair , pop bubble wrap or take an illegal nap .
unlike the Grand Canyon or the Washington Mon@@ ument , people come here to see what &apos;s no longer there .
in fact we &apos;re finishing a book which is called &quot; Ple@@ as@@ ure , &quot; which is about sensual pleasure in spaces .
and that was the mission that we came up with .
KA : shocking .
he had already ordered materials based on my go-@@ ahead .
DR : no , I don &apos;t think so .
which was very controversial , but it resonated with a lot of people .
the Prote@@ tch Gallery recently had a show on ideas for buildings , which had some sort of inventive ideas of buildings .
and find other ways to encourage the discussion to be against sort of monolithic , single solutions , and more about a multiplicity of things .
but were you conscious of memorials ? the Vietnam Memorial ?
this shows Saint Paul &apos;s on the left .
there were countries that did not recognize pharmaceutical product patents , such as India , and Indian pharmaceutical companies started to produce so-called generic versions , low-cost copies of antiretroviral medicines , and make them available in the developing world , and within a year the price had come down from 10,000 dollars per patient per year to 350 dollars per patient per year , and today that same triple pill cocktail is available for 60 dollars per patient per year , and of course that started to have an enormous effect on the number of people who could afford access to those medicines .
he has access to antiretroviral drugs .
so I discovered some very interesting things .
my friends , the doodle has never been the ne@@ mesis of intellectual thought .
Kim Gor@@ gens : protecting the brain against concussion
there &apos;s the traditional crafts , and then there &apos;s the technology crafts .
so one of the first things we did is this thing called a multimedia platform . we call it a lunch box .
so there is this amazing concept called the one-@@ teacher school , which is basically a single teacher who is a multi@@ tas@@ ker who teaches this amazing little social setting .
so , what we &apos;re going to do is that we &apos;re going to measure a few basic parameters on you , including your pulse rate and the amount of oxygen that &apos;s there in your blood .
Bruno Giussani : like this , works ?
so ...
basically this is a micro-controller with a few extra components that can be shipped for very little cost across the world , and that &apos;s what is all required with a little bit of local tinkering talent to convert the device into something else .
and so there &apos;s a very instinctive way in which we briefly transmit emotions to each other .
would you rather be C or D ?
so different structural locations have different implications for your life .
if I was always violent towards you or gave you mis@@ information or made you sad or infected you with deadly germs , you would cut the ties to me , and the network would disintegrate .
now there are problems associated with aging -- diseases , poverty , loss of social status .
and under conditions where it really matters , older people do process the negative information just as well as the positive information .
they &apos;ve called me &quot; brother &quot; and &quot; uncle &quot; and invited me again and again over five years .
the Fort Laramie Treaty called for at least three-quarters of the tribe to sign away land .
18@@ 87 : the Daw@@ es Act .
50 percent of the population over the age of 40 suffers from diabetes .
I &apos;ve put a bunch of examples up here .
you get it , either in pill form or you get it as an injection ; you have to take it every day to maintain your blood sugar levels .
it &apos;s more complex than that .
see what &apos;s really puzzling and frustrating about the last mile , to me , is that the first 999 miles are all about science .
how much are we putting into energy behavior change in a credible , systematic , testing way ?
forty percent of it is about what marketing is .
and then we say , &quot; Well , you want to get this behavior change .
I was here about four years ago , talking about the relationship of design and happiness .
and similarly , she finds prototyping boards really frustrating for her little hands .
if I push these together , the light turns off .
if I want a spinning tail , let &apos;s grab a motor , put some play-dough on it , stick it on and we have spinning .
OK . another person . Oh , I forgot , I shouldn &apos;t shuffle but I think -- -- actually , my technique is to peek , all the time .
so I start with the ace -- yeah , ace . ah , yeah -- spades ?
I like this guy , yeah .
Ar@@ man@@ i -- who said Ar@@ man@@ i ? you ?
two -- and it was two of spades , right ?
and the 11-year-old , one impulse on the whole phrase .
that &apos;s the second group .
amazing number of people think they &apos;re tone-deaf .
we have a B. This is a B. The next note is a C .
that &apos;s why Shakespeare puts all that stuff in Hamlet -- you know , O@@ phe@@ lia going mad and the play within the play , and Yor@@ ick &apos;s skull , and the grave@@ dig@@ gers .
and this is the question : who am I being , that my players &apos; eyes are not shining ?
now , can we do that ? no . and we &apos;ll make ourselves wrong and others wrong . but it is a possibility to live into . thank you .
Dan Pallotta : the way we think about charity is dead wrong
interesting that we don &apos;t have a visceral reaction to the notion that people would make a lot of money not helping other people .
now , there &apos;s no way you &apos;re going to get a lot of people with $ 400,000 talent to make a $ 3@@ 16,000 sacrifice every year to become the CEO of a hunger charity .
our attitude is , &quot; Well , look , if you can get the advertising donated , you know , at four o &apos;clock in the morning , I &apos;m okay with that .
and if you can &apos;t grow , you can &apos;t possibly solve large social problems .
Ann@@ al@@ isa Smi@@ th-@@ Pallotta : that would be -- S@@ age Smi@@ th-@@ Pallotta : -- a real social -- Ri@@ der Smi@@ th-@@ Pallotta : -- innovation .
representing that eight and a half minutes that it takes light and gravity to connect the two .
this one is about the Moon and then the distance to the Earth , in proportion also .
it dul@@ ls thinking and blocks creativity .
you want to be looking around .
I &apos;m an American ; I don &apos;t believe in philosophy .
in the 20th century , we came up with this idea of management .
work on anything you want . &quot;
okay ? radical amounts of autonomy .
Itay Talgam : lead like the great conductors
in Tel Aviv they come to my concerts . &quot;
did you see this kind of movement ? let me conduct you . twice .
and then like Karajan . let &apos;s see what happens . okay ?
now that &apos;s great . what about the eyes ?
we have the magic porridge pot in the form of Walmart and Tes@@ co .
and we have the el@@ ves in the form of China .
well , this is about state budgets .
there are various things in here : I could say we might raise more revenue , or medical innovation will make the spending even higher .
these floats reveal that the upper half of the ocean is gaining heat at a substantial rate .
clearly , I haven &apos;t gotten this message across .
these are particularly dangerous because there is no mask on my face .
and people are looking like this ...
just basically though , it is a basic piece of equipment .
in 1960 , Joseph Kit@@ ten@@ ger of the United States Air Force did the most spectacular thing .
this is him in a pressure suit .
good morning . how are you ? it &apos;s been great , hasn &apos;t it ?
anyway , he was really upset on the plane , and he said , &quot; I &apos;ll never find another girl like Sarah . &quot;
so the hierarchy is rooted on two ideas .
this talk is about righting writing wrongs .
but they know there is this myth that children from the slums cannot speak English well .
and he graduated with his doctorate from Harvard , and he set up a little consulting shop in White Plains , New York .
what we do is you make up a big experimental batch of Pepsi , at every degree of sweetness -- eight percent , 8.1 , 8.@@ 2 , 8.@@ 3 , all the way up to 12 -- and we try this out with thousands of people , and we plot the results on a curve , and we take the most popular concentration . right ? really simple .
the quality of the tomato paste is much better ; the spice mix is far superior ; it adher@@ es to the pasta in a much more pleasing way . in fact , they would do the famous bowl test back in the &apos; 70s with Ragu and Prego .
and they reflect a dic@@ hot@@ omy of art and delight on left and the right ; tradition and revolution on the top and the bottom .
sequence is a very important aspect of comics .
and this temporal map was something that energi@@ zes modern comics , but I was wondering if perhaps it also energi@@ zes other sorts of forms , and I found some in history .
now , it could be that motion pictures -- and eventually , virtual reality , or something equivalent to it -- some sort of immersive display , is going to provide us with our most efficient escape from the world that we &apos;re in .
it &apos;s funny , my wife , Daisy , whose family is littered with schizophrenics -- and I mean littered with them -- once said to me , &quot; Chris , I already have a brother who thinks he &apos;s God .
this is the exact opposite of the way that anger and fear and panic , all of the flight-@@ or-@@ fight responses , operate .
but back in 2009 , the question Joel and I kept turning over and over was why this late in the game so much energy was being spent talking about the science when the policies necessary to address climate change were une@@ qui@@ voc@@ ally beneficial for humanity in the long run regardless of the science .
you &apos;ve got to love that idea .
and in Western Europe mostly try to stay away from any long-distance relationships , big group@@ ings , group@@ ings that go back a long time , longer than the familiar families .
solemn design is often important and very effective design .
it can be achieved out of innocence , or arrogance , or out of selfishness , sometimes out of carelessness .
and I &apos;m going to show them to you now , because they came out of very specific conditions .
and what I responded to was , you know , Art Nou@@ ve@@ au , or dec@@ o , or Victorian typography , or things that were just completely not Helvetica .
so , here was the second condition for which I think I accomplished some serious play .
here &apos;s an ad in the New York Times somebody did for a play called &quot; Mind G@@ ames . &quot;
then &quot; Chicago &quot; came out , used similar graphics , and the Public Theater &apos;s identity was just totally eaten and taken away , which meant I had to change it .
and then I spent a year going to long , tedious , boring meetings , trying to sell this logo through to a huge corporation to the point of tears .
now jellyfish are strangely hypnotic and beautiful , and you &apos;ll see lots of gorgeous ones at the aquarium on Friday , but they sting like hell , and jellyfish sushi and sashimi is just not going to fill you up .
from their little hat@@ ching size of their egg , into their little lar@@ val stage till they reach adulthood , they put on 600 million times an increase in weight .
now I don &apos;t know how you &apos;d feed a child like that but -- we don &apos;t know how fast the Molas grow in the wild , but captive growth studies at the Monterey Bay Aquarium -- one of the first places to have them in captivity -- they had one that gained 800 lbs in 14 months .
and unfortunately , they make up a large portion of the California by-@@ catch -- up to 26 percent of the drift net .
and it just so happens that &apos;s a parasite hanging off the Mola .
do they go from one side of the Pacific to the other ?
they &apos;re super industrious .
today we don &apos;t need one million light bulbs to create a spherical display .
there are four on-board micro-controllers that , each time this ring rotates it , as it passes the rear of the display , it picks up a position signal .
and I started watching Ka@@ ki King a lot , and she would always cite Preston Reed as a big influence , so then I started watching his videos , and it &apos;s very surreal right now to be -- CA : was that piece just now , that was one of his songs that you learned , or how did that happen ?
Indra saw the woman , a Se@@ kh@@ ri .
they try and build it . they try and build pipelines ; it doesn &apos;t happen .
I &apos;m starting the story with the first atomic bomb at Trin@@ ity , which was the Manhattan Project . it was a little bit like TED : it brought a whole lot of very smart people together .
von Neumann , and a log@@ ician , and a mathematician from the army put this together . then , they needed a place to build it .
reports were issued , so that this machine was cloned at 15 other places around the world .
&quot; here lies mouse . born : ? . died : 4 : 50 a.m. , May 1953 . &quot;
that was designed on that machine , in the woods behind the Institute .
these guys hacked into Fox News &apos; Twitter account to announce President Obama &apos;s assassin@@ ation .
and of course , who could escape the irony of a member of Rupert Mur@@ doch &apos;s News Cor@@ p .
there &apos;s a strong whi@@ ff of half-@@ baked an@@ arch@@ ism about them .
and so nothing is going into the hackers .
now he developed his social and moral compass on the Black Sea port during the 1990s .
let &apos;s start with the Main Street .
big companies . big companies .
but I &apos;m killing them .
the lunch ladies , the lunch cooks of America -- I offer myself as their ambassador .
we don &apos;t teach kids about food . right ?
let &apos;s go back to the home .
I was worried about vaginas . I was worried what we think about vaginas , and even more worried that we don &apos;t think about them .
I talked with over 200 women . I talked to older women , younger women , married women , les@@ bians , single women ; I talked to corporate professionals , college professors , actors , sex workers ; I talked to African-American women , Asi@@ an-American women , Na@@ tive-@@ American women , Cau@@ ca@@ sian women , Jewish women .
one woman took that energy and she said , &quot; I want to bring this wave , this energy , to college cam@@ pu@@ ses , &quot; and so she took the play and she said , &quot; Let &apos;s use the play and have performances of the play once a year , where we can raise money to stop violence against women in local communities all around the world . &quot;
but every single country I have been to -- and in the last six years I &apos;ve been to about 45 countries , and many tiny little villages and cities and towns -- I have seen something what I &apos;ve come to call &quot; vagina warriors . &quot;
but , being a vagina warrior , she kept going , and she kept committing herself to transforming consciousness .
and as a consequence of that presumption , my hometown was burned to the ground by an invading army , an experience that has be@@ fallen many a Hungarian town and village throughout its long and troubled history .
he had installed the heavy equipment for his new process in an abandoned store in the vicinity of Kings Mountain , and for two months these 16 men would live and work together , master@@ ing the new process .
&quot; Aha ! &quot; said Dr. Robicsek . &quot; I went to the movie all by myself . &quot;
and in the process , what that allows us to do is to re@@ direct a lot more of our growth back into existing communities that could use a boost , and have the infrastructure in place , instead of continuing to tear down trees and to tear up the green space out at the edges .
this project , I think , has great connectivity to the existing neighborhoods .
in fact , we ripped down the galleries to recreate entirely different settings , a recreation of his first studio , a hall of mirrors , a curiosity box , a sun@@ ken ship , a bur@@ ne@@ d-out interior , with videos and sound@@ tracks that ran@@ ged from operatic arias to pigs for@@ nic@@ ating .
I heard over and over again , &quot; Wow , that was worth it .
in a camp with 90,000 people , you have to come up with some rules or there is going to be some fights .
well , there &apos;s also another program , in another agency within our government , in ocean exploration .
why ? why are we looking up ? is it because it &apos;s heaven ?
and so it &apos;s very difficult to get there , if you do it physically .
we understood mountains under compression , but we could not understand why we had a mountain under tension .
so the Easter Bun@@ ny has put things in the ocean floor , and you have massive heavy metal deposits that we &apos;re making in this mountain range .
their bodies had been totally taken over by another organism , a bacterium , that had figured out how to replicate photosynthesis in the dark , through a process we now call chemosyn@@ thesis .
instead of bel@@ ching out lava , they were bel@@ ching out big , big bubbles of methane . and they were creating these volcanoes , and there were flows , not of lava , but of the mud coming out of the Earth but driven by -- I &apos;ve never seen this before .
we own all of that blue and yet , like I say , particularly the western territorial trust , we don &apos;t have maps of them . we don &apos;t have maps of them .
but even in parts of the world like the United States where education is available , it might not be within reach .
you can break up the material , for example , into these short , modular units of eight to 12 minutes , each of which represents a coherent concept .
they &apos;re typing their program into the browser , and you can see they didn &apos;t get it quite right , Lady Liberty is still seas@@ ick .
but this is not just about students sitting alone in their living room working through problems .
so maybe this is how we should spend our time at universities .
or this ad that I read in the New York Times : &quot; wearing a fine watch speaks loudly of your rank in society .
or women making fun of men is the same as men making fun of women .
I really miss the old t@@ elem@@ ar@@ ke@@ ters now , I &apos;ll tell you that .
but the interactivity allows the audience to shape what you &apos;re going to do as much as you shape their experience of the world .
I hope that &apos;s my agent , because you aren &apos;t paying me anything .
but if you don &apos;t do that , if you allow for the accident to keep on happening , you have the possibility of getting on a wavelength .
I like to think of what I do as a probability wave .
but there was something else that I &apos;ve noticed as those changes were taking place , as people were starting to find out that hmm ... yeah , there really is a black hole at the center of every galaxy .
we don &apos;t really have mental health insurance in this country , and it &apos;s -- -- it &apos;s really a crime .
moving on . number nine -- don &apos;t laugh -- aliens invade Earth .
we have lost 25 percent of the unique species in Hawaii in the last 20 years .
we need to know earlier that they &apos;re getting in trouble , and we need to be able to pump possible solutions into models .
this stuff was supposed to only be feed for animals in the United States , and it got into the human food supply , and somebody should &apos;ve figured out that it would get in the human food supply very easily .
I wrote a story about this in Life magazine in 1993 .
about a billion miles away , here &apos;s what happens to Earth &apos;s orbit : it becomes elliptical instead of circular .
now , the trouble with just sending a bomb out for this thing is that you don &apos;t have anything to push against in space , because there &apos;s no air .
and these two war against one another almost continuously .
some of you remember this , I &apos;m sure .
they are changing rapidly , but not predictably .
fiber : next-@@ generation way of communicating .
this is what one of those primary nodes looks like , and it &apos;s like a sub station with power and bandwidth that can spread out over an area the size of Seattle .
and the kind of science that can be done will be determined by a variety of scientists who want to be involved and can bring the instrumentation to the table .
now I want to take you into the cal@@ dera .
robotics systems are just incredible these days , absolutely incredible .
and I think , when I listen to these incredible people here , I &apos;ve been so inspired -- so many incredible ideas , so many visions .
and that wonder is really what has created the greatest cities , the greatest spaces that we have had .
it &apos;s about conserving emotions , conserving the traditions that have obstruc@@ ted the mind in moving forward and of course what is radical is to confront them .
but architecture is not the language of words .
the memorable , I think , is really our world , what we think the world is .
and of course that is finally what I believe architecture to be .
and it is about the dirty word &quot; compromise . &quot; compromise is not bad .
with independence , the whole approach of community getting involved was embraced by our new government .
and that was a very strong thing in Namibia .
and several things are important .
finally catches up to itself , it advances .
if you line up 2@@ 95 of those nose to tail , that &apos;s about how far back that was .
this is what we need to favor .
there &apos;s a rum@@ ble in my stomach .
I mean after all , this whole business happened on his watch .
if it comes up , some of them will be submerged .
or is this just right for this place ?
the combination of spin , on the one hand , and the Internet on the other .
so having people involved in planning for 2020 is not necessarily going to change anything , because the dictators are still the ones who control the agenda .
because even what has been happening up &apos; til now with the Sp@@ internet and authoritarian deliberation , there is a great chance that those voices will not be heard .
thank you .
the thing that sticks with me the most is that he was apologi@@ zing to me for crying in front of me , and at the same time , he was also giving me props , lifting me up , for not crying .
we kind of see ourselves separate , but we &apos;re very much a part of it .
after all , what constitutes a world leader ?
and we continue to grow . when the rest of the world took a beating last year , we grew at 6@@ .7 percent .
and so I wondered , could what the future bec@@ k@@ ons for India to be all about be a combination of these things alli@@ ed to something else , the power of example , the attraction of India &apos;s culture , what , in other words , people like to call &quot; soft power . &quot;
and of course they have more influence , sometimes , about how they &apos;re seen .
but , the issue is that when I talked about that example , it &apos;s not just about talking about India , it &apos;s not propaganda .
we have 23 official languages that are recognized in our Con@@ stitution .
so I grew up in Limpopo , on the border of Limpopo and M@@ pum@@ al@@ anga , a little town called Mot@@ et@@ ema .
water and electricity supply are as unpredictable as the weather , and growing up in these tough situations , at the age of 17 , I was relaxing with a couple of friends of mine in winter , and we were sun@@ bathing .
and if an antibody is stuck to one of these things on the cell , it means &quot; that &apos;s food . &quot;
I &apos;m talking about the concept of using suspended animation to help people out in trauma .
and then , they will have the time , that will buy them the time , to be transported to the hospital to get the care they need .
am I hearing a few &quot; sorry &apos;s &quot; ? I think I &apos;m hearing a few sorry &apos;s .
they lose this stuff that facilit@@ ates this sort of playful and building mode of thinking .
they transition in and out of it , and good teachers spend a lot of time thinking about how to move kids through these experiences .
my partner and I , Thom , we had to let all our employees go .
and I said , &quot; Yes , I would love to do that . it sounds great . &quot;
and the soprano section is just full of hot girls . &quot;
and there were a lot of cute girls in the soprano section , as it turns out .
I said , &quot; Well , if you guys rent the high-speed video system that could capture these movements , you guys can film us collecting the data . &quot;
so the muscle contracts , and nothing happens .
that &apos;s a bit long , but it is sort of interesting .
she has twice the wingspan that I do .
and cholera was really the great killer of this period .
we had to get rid of the smell .
so this was the state of London in 1854 , and in the middle of all this carnage and offensive conditions , and in the midst of all this scientific confusion about what was actually killing people , it was a very talented classic 19th century multi-@@ discipl@@ in@@ arian named John Snow , who was a local doctor in Soho in London , who had been arguing for about four or five years that cholera was , in fact , a waterborne disease , and had basically convinced nobody of this .
he suspected an outbreak that concentrated would probably involve a single point source .
Phil Borges on endangered cultures
this is Pal@@ din .
and I was watching this crowd of monks and nuns , many of which I had just interviewed , and heard their stories , and I watched their faces , and they gave us a little FM radio , and we could listen to the translation of his teachings .
they could hear things , smell things , see things I couldn &apos;t see .
and this kid lived in the village -- he wasn &apos;t there at the time -- and this is the little movie he put together about that .
and he hadn &apos;t seen a computer before we did this movie . we taught him Photoshop and -- yeah , we can play it .
it &apos;s like you can &apos;t see to the center of the Sun ; you have to use other techniques to know what &apos;s going on inside the Sun .
so we have this picture , which is quite a spectacular picture , and I &apos;ll come back to the beginning , where we &apos;re going to have some mysterious process that kicks the universe off at the beginning .
it &apos;s a marker of where the interesting waves are and whatever went on .
it was a really very stressful time .
I love this .
an 18@@ -year-old boy who uses texting for almost everything says to me wi@@ st@@ fully , &quot; Some@@ day , someday , but certainly not now , I &apos;d like to learn how to have a conversation . &quot;
and we clean them up with technology .
we short-@@ change ourselves .
solitude is where you find yourself so that you can reach out to other people and form real attach@@ ments .
I love poetry and always had an interest in that somehow .
but I &apos;d want one that could play , too .
but it &apos;s actually not a new field .
you saw the spray going in .
so the strategy here is -- this is actually a CT scan , an X-ray -- and we go layer by layer , using computerized morph@@ ometric imaging analysis and 3D reconstruction to get right down to those patient &apos;s own kidneys .
there were a couple that were a little stubborn , but I had to talk to them .
I think it was bought for us around three years ago for a Christmas present .
so in other words , what &apos;s happening here is that Swaptree solves my carrying company &apos;s sugar rush problem , a problem the economists call &quot; the coincidence of wants , &quot; in approximately 60 seconds .
I &apos;m not asking people to share nicely in the sand@@ pit .
this represents an eight-@@ year time span .
Mo : we need to tell people what not to bring .
there &apos;s a gap here .
emergency preparedness is a big deal in disaster recovery because it makes towns safer and more resilient .
so , that &apos;s Kibera , the largest squatter community in Nairobi .
they &apos;re quite vital places , these communities .
this is commerce in Kenya , right along the train tracks , so close to the train tracks that the merchants sometimes have to pull the merchandise out of the way .
this is a shopping street in Kibera , and you can see that there &apos;s a soda dealer , a health clinic , two beauty sal@@ ons , a bar , two grocery stores , and a church , and more .
one is people need a guarantee they won &apos;t be ev@@ ic@@ ted .
you &apos;re allowed to have an elected government , collect taxes , provide municipal services , and that &apos;s exactly what they do .
so I said to myself , with all these hundred other boys , this is where I belong .
so I said , &quot; I &apos;m going to dedicate myself .
the slaughter of millions in the trenches and in the death camps have caused people to ask , &quot; Where is God in all this ?
we have a pra@@ m service on Tuesday mornings for m@@ ums and their pre-@@ school children .
but what if God doesn &apos;t act ? what if God doesn &apos;t do things at all ?
to have faith in this God would be more like trusting an essential ben@@ evolence in the universe , and less like believing a system of doctr@@ inal statements .
Namaste .
we had tables , chairs , computers , everything .
and what we were trying to offer every day was one-on-one attention .
and so most of these students , English is not spoken in the home .
so that was the basis of it , was one-on-one attention .
we created a website .
because they had banker hours basically .
we just have to find them the right place .
I thought it was just like the movies , but the movies had not conve@@ yed them in the powerful image that I was seeing full of bright red and orange and gray , and a full circle of explosion .
it is actually about silence , the silence of humanity . &quot;
how casually we treat casualties in the context of this topic .
I opened up a magazine , and V@@ isa &apos;s branding was , &quot; Business Ta@@ kes Simplicity . &quot;
last year at TED , these were all my titles . I had a lot of titles .
she passed away in 1994 , and I was hired back to MIT to try to fill her shoes , but it &apos;s so hard .
I wrote computer programs to make complex graphics like this .
I took these to Tokyo in 2001 to make computer objects .
this is a new way to type , on my old , color C@@ las@@ sic .
basically , it always depends .
and so life is a big question , I think , in simplicity , because you &apos;re trying to simplify your life .
I &apos;m a big advocate of changing the light@@ bulbs and buying hybrids , and Tipper and I put 33 solar panels on our house , and dug the geothermal wells , and did all of that other stuff .
and each level of conflict requires a different allocation of resources , a different approach , a different organizational model .
plans to fight poverty in Uganda are mo@@ oted , if we do not solve the climate crisis .
the richness and ful@@ lness of the dialogue in our democracy has not laid the basis for the kind of bold initiative that is really needed .
ag : I have prayed that I would be able to find the answer to that question . what can I do ?
in this case I &apos;m showing more the designers &apos; work , because they &apos;re the ones that have really been stimulated .
also , we do it in order to share with other people .
so this is exactly what I did . we started bringing a team together , an interdisciplinary team of scientists , of economists , mathematicians .
so this graph here , I &apos;m going to show you now .
if you put too much cold water in , it will shatter .
he goes into the synagogue . &quot; God , will you please help me ?
and I guess we were sharing -- we had that regular life of the only independent media in the country , operating in hostile environment , where government really wants to make your life miserable .
and I won &apos;t go into a lot of stuff about quantum mechanics and what it &apos;s like , and so on .
there are lots of more sophisticated examples .
so we say , in general , that there &apos;s a symmetry under certain operations if those operations leave the phenomenon , or its description , unchanged .
so here we say , again , what we said before : that each skin of the onion shows a similarity to the ad@@ joining skins .
so since I tell stories , let me look back on the lives of two of the presidents I &apos;ve studied to illustrate this point -- Abraham Lincoln and Lyndon Johnson .
he was so depressed that friends worried he was suicidal .
he said , &quot; If ever my soul were in an act , it is in this act .
we want to hear about that man who spoke with a voice of thunder , who laughed like the sunrise , who came from that place called America , which is so far from here , that if a young man should travel there , he would be an old man when he arrived .
and he had somewhat of a minor league woman@@ izing reputation .
so between his nightly tre@@ ks to the theater , his story telling , and his extraordinary sense of humor and his love of quoting Shakespeare and poetry , he found that form of play which carried him through his days .
I must say , so fer@@ vent was my love of the old Brooklyn Dodgers in those days that I had to confess in my first confession two sins that related to baseball .
it &apos;s not a sin . &quot;
allowing me to believe that the private people we have loved and lost in our families , and the public figures we have respected in our history , just as Abraham Lincoln wanted to believe , really can live on , so long as we pledge to tell and to re@@ tell the stories of their lives .
&quot; thus said Cyrus , king of Per@@ sia , &apos; All the kingdoms of the earth have the Lord God of heaven given thee , and he has charged me to build him a house in Jerusalem .
as you all know , that return from exile , the second temple , reshaped Judaism .
and the result of that was an empire that included the areas you see on the screen , and which survived for 200 years of stability until it was shattered by Alexander .
meanwhile , back in Babylon , things had not been going well .
and great excitement to a world where those who believed in the scriptures had had their faith in creation sha@@ ken by evolution , by geology , here was evidence that the scriptures were historically true .
and I wanted it to be the 21st of September because it was my granddad &apos;s favorite number .
but it didn &apos;t matter because we were documenting , and that was the thing .
and now I was thinking , &quot; Well , the press it really going to hear this story . &quot;
and we have to make this day work .
I said , &quot; What would you do ?
and it then made me think about a glass of water , which is clear .
the second time was a procedure that involved local anesthesia .
we had just had a military coup , and soldiers were pervasive in our society .
they wanted us to think critically .
and at this time , when I was going through what I call my &quot; pre-@@ mid-@@ life crisis , &quot; Africa was a mess .
but , for me , I asked the question , &quot; Well , where are these leaders coming from ?
that if we involve them in their education , if we have them discuss the real issues that they confront -- that our whole society confron@@ ts -- and if we give them skills that enable them to engage the real world , that magic will happen .
and it said , very simply , &quot; I am thinking now . &quot;
her understanding that a student-@@ crafted honor code constitutes a reach towards perfection is incredible .
the persistence , their ability to deal with ambiguity , their ability to tackle problems that they haven &apos;t seen before .
and it &apos;s just wonderful to see these glim@@ mers of the promise of what can happen if we train our kids right .
we provide the patients , the Afghan disabled , first with the physical rehabilitation then with the social reintegration .
is it really necessary ? &quot;
what &apos;s next ? what is going to be the next change ?
I feel like I have all these ideas existing embedded inside of me , and it &apos;s these conversations and these experiences that connect these ideas , and they kind of instinctively come out .
I &apos;ll explain that in just a moment .
we call her &quot; The Tal@@ ons . &quot;
Hmm . you &apos;ve heard of it .
we really would love to have suggestions from you folks on how to contact federal , state and local authorities to get them to do something .
they shamel@@ essly promote all kinds of nonsense of this sort because it ple@@ ases the sponsors .
in the hospital and in the entire region there &apos;s not a single biomedical engineer .
and the World Bank sees this and estimates that a hospital in this setting in a low-income country can expect up to 18 power out@@ ages per month .
he went to work every day in an operating theater like this one , trying to deliver anesthesia and teach others how to do so using that same equipment that became so unreliable , and frankly unsafe , in his hospital .
voila !
let &apos;s pretend that our government supported an oil@@ -based economy , while discoura@@ ging more sustainable forms of energy , knowing all the while that the result would be pollution , war and rising costs .
and guess what ?
so , now we clam@@ or for organic food .
70 percent of the agricultural land on Earth , 30 percent of the Earth &apos;s land surface is directly or indirectly devoted to raising the animals we &apos;ll eat .
there is no good reason for eating as much meat as we do .
we can continue to enjoy our food , and we continue to eat well , and we can eat even better .
can &apos;t see it because it &apos;s too big .
so that &apos;s the first big problem .
John Hockenberry : it &apos;s great to be here with you , Tom .
and so for me , it was really exciting just to see what it looks like if you could step outside and into a larger context , as though you were an astronaut , and see these two things as an object , because they are so intimately bound , and one is meaningless without the other .
JH : I agree .
and that &apos;s the symbol of their culture .
next is by a Li@@ thu@@ anian fortune t@@ eller , Jur@@ gi Pe@@ tra@@ us@@ kas .
and she &apos;s one of the most prolific of all these hundred artists , even though she &apos;s going to be 90 next year .
and that is what origami used to be .
and you &apos;d think , &quot; Can four simple laws give rise to that kind of complexity ? &quot;
these techniques revolutionized this art .
in American fertility clinics , 75 percent of couples are request@@ ing girls and not boys .
the first was that these were no longer just temporary hits that the recession was giving men -- that this was reflecting a deeper underlying shift in our global economy .
and they come up in lots of different forms .
and it has become a kind of a tru@@ ism in the study of creativity that you can &apos;t be creating anything with less than 10 years of techn@@ ic@@ al-@@ knowledge immersion in a particular field .
and like all of these successful and responsible CEOs say , you can &apos;t have just one of these things be successful if you want a meaningful and successful job .
but there is a continuous world from walking , biking , driving , flying -- there are people on all levels , and most people tend to be somewhere in the middle .
so we used ultraviolet A , which doesn &apos;t make vitamin D .
how much sunlight is safe , and how can we fin@@ es@@ se this best for our general health ?
so , thank you very much indeed .
it was , &quot; Which color would you like ? &quot;
but everybody else was looking in the bush and looking in the dit@@ ches for golf balls .
just do that kind of stuff and have fun with it .
but teach them how to fix the price , guess the price , pull up the photos .
your skin re@@ generates every two weeks .
you place the vascular blood vessel lining cells on the inside .
and if possible , we &apos;d rather use the cells from your very specific organ .
lest you think I exaggerate , here are the beginnings of the A-@@ B-@@ Cs of anthropology .
you can be sure Jefferson knew what he was talking about when he said , &quot; If a nation expects to be ignorant and free in a state of civilization , it expects what never was , and never will be . &quot;
and the point is not to treat these topics as topics of study , but as frameworks of action .
the challenge : to figure out what it will take to actually do something that makes a significant and sustainable difference .
you are not the first to try to figure this out , just as you are unlikely to be the last .
we actually do it all the time .
what is certain is that the individual talent exhibited in such abundance here , needs to turn its attention to that collaborative , messy , frustrating , contentious and impossible world of politics and public policy .
being overwhelmed is the first step if you are serious about trying to get at things that really matter , on a scale that makes a difference .
and not only food , right .
now , I know you don &apos;t believe me , really , here .
there is no creator here to be recognized .
now , this explains the right-wing nonprofit Creative Commons .
John McCain .
the microbes in your gut can influence your weight and your mo@@ ods .
we know that microbes are dispersed around by people and by air .
speaking at a TED Sal@@ on in London , economist Martin Jacques asks : how do we in the West make sense of China and its phenomenal rise ? the author of &quot; When China R@@ ules the World , &quot; he examines why the West often puzzles over the growing power of the Chinese economy , and offers three building blocks for understanding what China is and will become .
let me offer you another building block to try and understand China -- maybe not sort of a comfortable one .
unfortunately , I think , I have to say that I think attitude towards China is that of a kind of little Wester@@ ner mentality .
so I decided to go further in this direction and go in places where there were zero museums .
this time we covered the roofs of the houses , but we didn &apos;t use paper , because paper doesn &apos;t prevent the rain from leaking inside the house -- vinyl does .
and most of what you see -- that &apos;s a trailer from &quot; Women Are Heroes &quot; -- its images , photography , taken one after the other .
that &apos;s London .
this image of three men wearing gas masks was taken in Chernoby@@ l originally , and I pasted it in Southern Italy , where the mafia sometimes bury the garbage under the ground .
the full data is on the website -- insi@@ de@@ out@@ projec@@ t@@ .net -- that is launching today .
the other thing that &apos;s worth considering is that we &apos;ve made a huge investment over decades and decades , and tens of billions of dollars have gone into this investment that now is our inheritance .
they made it aspirational .
these platforms invite all sorts of developers and all sorts of people to come with their ideas and their opportunity to create and target an application for a particular audience .
so the opportunity when we &apos;re connected is also to share failures and successes .
I said , &quot; I &apos;m here to meet the Prime Minister . &quot;
then I said , all this is good , but I want to paint like a real painter .
I talked about this masculinity that one need not perform .
this one is called &quot; What the F@@ uck Was I Thinking ? &quot;
increasingly , over time , this will be possible from our own skin -- able to replicate parts of the body .
these will be redundant concepts . and this isn &apos;t only something of the West .
the war on talent , the need to attract people at all skill ranges , to push us around in our wheelchairs , but also to drive our economies . our innovation will be vital .
and after hundreds of conversations with teenagers and teachers and parents and employers and schools from Par@@ agu@@ ay to Australia , and looking at some of the academic research , which showed the importance of what &apos;s now called non-@@ cognitive skills -- the skills of motivation , resilience -- and that these are as important as the cognitive skills -- formal academic skills -- we came up with an answer , a very simple answer in a way , which we called the Studio School .
we think we &apos;re onto something .
my inability to swim has been one of my greatest humili@@ ations and embarra@@ ssments .
incorrect , above , which is what almost every swimming coach will teach you .
I arrived in Tokyo . amazing .
you &apos;ve never seen a more confused Japanese woman .
went in , paid my ten pe@@ sos , walked up -- 10 women two guys , usually a good ratio .
I interviewed these people because they all taught in Buenos Aires .
long steps . so a lot of mil@@ on@@ gu@@ er@@ os -- the tango dancers will use very short steps .
especially with fears you gained when you were a child .
SW : yeah . she would get really , really excited .
SW : yeah , that &apos;s right . but you don &apos;t like to drink beer , Einstein .
she thinks Al Gore is a really good-looking man .
SW : big finish .
how do we manage the quality control ?
so , I mentioned earlier , people type AS@@ D@@ F@@ AS@@ D@@ F -- it needs to be deleted . cases like that , the administrators just delete it .
they always think they &apos;ve got 40,000 members when they &apos;ve got 18 .
romantic love is one of the most powerful sensations on Earth .
two thousand years later , we can explain this in the brain .
in this case , life &apos;s greatest prize : an appropriate mating partner .
you had to go to the library , see if you could get them to find the books for you , you know , foot@@ notes and all that .
so this is called &quot; Tembererana . &quot;
we have a hundred years of experience .
so just as a curiosity , where did you land when you flew over the Grand Canyon ?
and they don &apos;t perceive even those as what they really are , namely electrical cr@@ ackles .
next step in my process .
Is@@ ab@@ elle : &quot; the filmmaker Georges M@@ éliès was one of the first to realize that films had the power to capture dreams . &quot;
so this is that story .
and I &apos;m so passionate about it .
we &apos;ve got to get the story out now . thank you very much .
if we look at biology , and many of you probably don &apos;t know , I was a biology major before I went into architecture , the human skin is the organ that naturally regulates the temperature in the body , and it &apos;s a fantastic thing .
and because it has two different co@@ effici@@ ents of expansion , when heated , one side will expand faster than the other and result in a cur@@ ling action .
let &apos;s study some moral psychology and see where it takes us .
it gives us very strong feelings about those who cause harm .
the second foundation is fairness / reciprocity .
if you think about the sorts of things that we &apos;ve sent Australian military personnel to in recent years , we &apos;ve got obvious things like Iraq and Afghanistan , but you &apos;ve also got things like East Tim@@ or and the Sol@@ omon Islands and so on .
it is a lot more sophisticated than a microwave oven , but it is basically boiling the water molecules in the very surface level of your skin .
now when they introduced O.C. spray in Queensland , they were really explicit .
I &apos;m going to go out on a limb here and say that if Queensland police didn &apos;t have O.C. spray , they wouldn &apos;t have shot 2,@@ 2@@ 26 people in those two years .
one of the fundamental principles of military use of force is that you have to be discriminate .
and in fact , that &apos;s exactly what happened here .
I kid you not . that &apos;s exactly what it said .
they did that in the summer , and it was very warm .
that &apos;s another tool that &apos;s really taken off -- really , really interesting .
why is it glamorous ?
this is another Margaret Bour@@ ke-@@ White photo .
there &apos;s a glamour shot .
it was all about cleaning up Germany , and the West , and the world , and ri@@ dding it of anything un@@ glamorous .
in his new and visionary book , &quot; New Self , New World , &quot; the writer Philip Shepherd says , &quot; If you are divided from your body , you are also divided from the body of the world , which then appears to be other than you or separate from you , rather than the living continuum to which you belong . &quot;
and a few weeks later , I was in New Orleans , and this beautiful , spiritual friend told me she wanted to do a healing for me .
it takes children a long time to break into the system .
and while Ivan is away the wind comes , and it blows the sandwich down onto the grass .
uh-oh . why did he take that one ?
I &apos;m going to show you what happens when you put a quarter on the machine .
and the first thing is , people can still do this task overall .
I mean , what chances do you think there are that at some time in your career , someone , you or someone else , is going to come up with some paradigm shift in understanding what seems an impossible problem ?
we try and do more and more with less and less time .
so all of that said , is it , I guess , is it possible ?
I still love speed . you know , I live in London , and I work as a journalist , and I enjoy the buzz and the bu@@ sy@@ ness , and the adrenaline rush that comes from both of those things .
so the bandstand , as we call it , this is an incredible space .
therefore as India and Pakistan , as you and I , it be@@ hooves us to transcend our differences , to celebrate our diversity , to leverage our common humanity .
in Sri Lanka , if you go down to the south coast of Sri Lanka , during the northeast monsoon season , you can see blue whales very , very easily .
they need fresh water to breed .
so , they &apos;re very important .
didn &apos;t notice any dragonflies ; maybe they were there , maybe they weren &apos;t .
something like this , these are all this species Globe Sk@@ im@@ mer .
so , Maldives , beautiful place .
so , global warming , sea level rise , it &apos;s a real serious issue .
now , what I said was , you get the southwest monsoon going one way , and then it changes and you get the northeast monsoon going the other way .
I know because we have reports from Sey@@ ch@@ ell@@ es , which fit in as well , down here .
they have a little refueling stop in northeastern India .
he &apos;s an engineer .
in practice , the Norden bombsight can drop a bomb into a pickle barrel at 20,000 ft . , but that &apos;s under perfect conditions .
they could have destroyed this little thing right here from 25,000 ft .
why build a virtual world ? Philip Rosedale talks about the virtual society he founded , Second Life , and its underpin@@ nings in human creativity . it &apos;s a place so different that anything could happen .
second Life , by comparison , has about 100 terabytes of user-@@ created data , making it about 25,000 times larger .
like for example , in the 19th century , any number of works of literature that imagined alternative worlds were explicitly utopian .
and I remember that that was just so telling , you know , that you didn &apos;t know exactly what was going to happen .
you can have a baby in Second Life .
it &apos;s not easy to describe as a demographic .
JH : last question . right here .
and so I just came , two days ago , from the Himalayas to your kind invitation .
and the night before , we camped , and my Tibetan friends said , &quot; We are going to sleep outside . &quot; and I said , &quot; Why ? we have enough space in the tent . &quot;
as a Fren@@ chman , I must say that there are a lot of French intellectuals that think happiness is not at all interesting .
we know we &apos;re not always angry , always jealous , always generous .
so , because the basic fabric of consciousness is this pure cognitive quality that differenti@@ ates it from a stone , there is a possibility for change because all emotions are fleeting .
of course , during the training , we do that with objects .
one year later , how she is .
the first person to do this systematically was Lin@@ na@@ e@@ us , Carl von Lin@@ ne , a Swedish botanist , who in the eighteenth century took it upon himself to categorize every living organism on the planet .
so the whole world was drying out .
and it &apos;s based on a few thousand people we &apos;ve sampled from , you know , a handful of populations around the world .
but , in addition , we wanted to open up this study to anybody around the world .
and that &apos;s why that video feels a bit strange .
what we see around us is staggering complexity .
and at first , it &apos;s just a blur , but very quickly distinct things begin to appear in that blur .
it consisted of huge clouds of hydrogen and helium atoms , and they have no structure .
recent studies by satellites such as the WMAP satellite have shown that , in fact , there are just tiny differences in that background .
so we &apos;ve crossed a fourth threshold of complexity .
that operates over smaller scales than gravity , which explains why you and I are smaller than stars or planets .
in liquids , they can cruise and cu@@ ddle and link up to form molecules .
and what that means is that DNA is , in effect , learning .
now what makes humans different is human language .
and that means it can out@@ last the individuals who learned that information , and it can accumulate from generation to generation .
and the same weapons are still here , and they are still armed .
we have one person -- well , actually we &apos;re going to slice him in half because it &apos;s less than one percent .
who would go for bananas ?
if people have to check a lot of boxes to join a 401 plan , they &apos;re going to keep procra@@ stin@@ ating and not join .
I &apos;ve got a question for Randi .
it &apos;s actually a children &apos;s song but like so many projects for children it &apos;s really just a Trojan horse for adult work .
and at night I would lie out , looking at the un@@ polluted sky , as Delhi used to be at that time when I was a kid , and I used to stare at the universe and say , &quot; How far does this universe go ? &quot;
are you with child ?
Raleigh : Majesty .
Elizabeth : get out ! get out ! get out !
in the mind of a man and a woman , we &apos;re looking constantly at the contradiction between male and female , we &apos;re looking for harmony within each other .
a lot of people like to point to some place else as the cause of the problem .
you think that &apos;s not a question as to how we should be using the Earth &apos;s resources ?
in 2000 , we had six billion people on the planet .
they &apos;re all going to consume twice as much as they currently do -- scientists , again , agree -- because income is going to grow in developing countries five times what it is today -- on global average , about &#91; 2.@@ 9 &#93; .
better than lamb produced in New Zealand , frozen and shipped to the U.K. ?
we need Oxford to work with Cambridge .
even if we get everybody working on it , we &apos;ve got to be strategic .
we have to work in these places .
the good news is we identified a hundred companies two years ago .
that &apos;s not insignificant .
this is called bun@@ dling . it &apos;s bringing those externalities back into the price of the commodity .
the issue isn &apos;t what to think , it &apos;s how to think .
a few years ago , I did a meditation retreat in Thailand .
there &apos;s Ar@@ menian , Russian , French , English , Italian .
how can we measure what makes a school system work ? Andre@@ as Sch@@ le@@ ic@@ her walks us through the PISA test , a global measurement that ran@@ ks countries against one another -- then uses that same data to help schools improve . watch to find out where your country stacks up , and learn the single factor that makes some systems out@@ perform others .
you can see Shanghai , Korea , Singapore in Asia ; Finland in Europe ; Canada in North America doing really well .
a lot of potential of young children is wasted .
and then we can debate , you know , is it better to be there , where performance is strong at the price of large disparities ?
everybody says that .
if you go to Japan in Asia , or Finland in Europe , parents and teachers in those countries expect every student to succeed , and you can see that actually mir@@ ro@@ red in student behavior .
and they provide intelligent pathways for teachers to grow in their careers .
high performers have moved on from professional or from administrative forms of accountability and control -- sort of , how do you check whether people do what they &apos;re supposed to do in education -- to professional forms of work organization .
it advertised -- the way that you might be asked , if you were part of the Internet , to declare what you see near you -- it advertised that near it , in fact , it had suddenly awa@@ kened to find that it was YouTube .
and yet , somehow , within about two hours , the problem was fixed .
they &apos;ll fund anything these days .
because catching mice is what the two cats wanted to do .
and will Asia be able to handle that new position of being in charge of being the most mighty , and the govern@@ ors of the world ?
so I started looking for any evidence that -- does connectivity really increase productivity ?
so obviously this was a gadget to have .
but then we are limiting our economic sphere to something very small area .
this is what some people think .
most of them learn how to operate a telephone within a day .
we say , the ray of light came this way ; the galaxy must be there , OK .
but ignore the top part .
and also , you can tell by eye , by looking at this , that these ar@@ cs are not centered on individual galaxies .
so the evidence that we have that a quarter of the universe is dark matter -- this gravit@@ ationally attracting stuff -- is that galaxies , the speed with which stars orbiting galaxies is much too large ; it must be embedded in dark matter .
we have well-@@ motivated candidates for the dark matter .
they haven &apos;t seen anything , OK , but it puts limits on what the mass and the interaction strength of these dark matter particles are .
and we &apos;re very proud of giving information to people , so that little kids like this don &apos;t do stupid things .
we &apos;re not the first ones to build houses for our young .
they have asked themselves , &quot; What if , every time I started to invent something , I asked , &apos; How would nature solve this ? &apos; &quot; and here is what they &apos;re learning .
it &apos;s actually a company a company that I &apos;m involved in called O@@ ne@@ Sun , with Paul Hawken .
and the way that I &apos;m going to do that is , I &apos;m going to look across areas with different levels of malaria .
but because people who died this year of AIDS got it a few years ago , we can use this data on mortality to figure out what HIV prevalence was in the past .
so if you combine the intuition in this figure with some of the data that I talked about before , it suggests that somewhere between 25 percent and 50 percent of the decline in prevalence in Uganda actually would have happened even without any education campaign .
this is something like a new definition ever given in policing in India -- the power to prevent .
secondly is about the anti-@@ corruption movement in India .
by the way , you did hear me correctly ; his last name is H@@ acker .
this person starts apologi@@ zing for the fact that it &apos;s translated with a computer .
by the way , I &apos;m the one talking here , but actually Duolingo is the work of a really awesome team , some of whom are here .
it certainly seems that we &apos;re going about our lives , that what we &apos;re doing , who we &apos;re with , what we &apos;re thinking about , have a big influence on our happiness , and yet these are the very factors that have been very difficult , in fact almost impossible , for scientists to study .
as human beings , we have this unique ability to have our minds stray away from the present .
and there , I started by searching for the footprints in my childhood .
so when the echo of the gun@@ shots had lin@@ gered , it was soon drowned by the chanting of the mob , and I didn &apos;t believe what I was hearing .
and the religious people said that if God wanted you to make -- I mean , God is everywhere , that was one of their rules , is God is everywhere .
I mean , it just -- it just -- un@@ tangled a thing that was really impe@@ ding technology from being developed .
and they -- and they have these big meetings where they try to figure out how we &apos;re going to -- how we &apos;re going to continually prove that the planet is getting warmer , when that &apos;s actually contrary to most people &apos;s sensations .
it &apos;s like , the average temperature has gone up a tiny little bit , because the nighttime temperatures at the weather stations have come up just a little bit .
and most responsible people that measure temperatures realize you have to shield your measuring device from that .
and in this paper , they show something much more striking , and that was that they did what they call a radiation -- and I &apos;m not going to go into the details of it , actually it &apos;s quite complicated , but it isn &apos;t as complicated as they might make you think it is by the words they use in those papers . if you really get down to it , they say , the sun puts out a certain amount of energy -- we know how much that is -- it falls on the earth , the earth gives back a certain amount .
so the planet is a pretty amazing thing , you know , it &apos;s big and horrible -- and big and wonderful , and it does all kinds of things we don &apos;t know anything about .
you see the sun@@ beams coming from the ventilation ducts and the train approaching .
but within that infrastructure , we have to remember that the driving force of biology is really coming from evolution .
the other thing we need to think about is the emergence of chemical complexity .
I &apos;m going to try and explain why it is that perhaps we don &apos;t understand as much as we think we do .
I &apos;m not quite sure how he died , actually .
and , if you look at the , kind of the way these things are constructed , there &apos;s a lot of medi@@ ation by glass , and it &apos;s very blue , and kind of professional -- in that way that , you know , Woody Allen comes up from under the sheets in that scene in &quot; Annie Hall , &quot; and said , &quot; God , that &apos;s so professional . &quot; and that you don &apos;t -- there &apos;s no passion in it , and it &apos;s not hands on , right , and , you know , pun intended . whereas good interpretation -- I &apos;ll use an example from nearby -- is San Francisco Explor@@ at@@ orium , where all the things that -- the demonstrations , and so on , are made out of everyday objects that children can understand , it &apos;s very hands-on , and they can engage with , and experiment with .
take child mortality ; the aim here is to reduce child mortality by two-thirds , from 1990 to 2015 .
what we rely on is not an incomplete system .
have got these surveys in place in their database , then they use advanced mathematical formulas to produce a trend line , and the trend line looks like this .
it was so tragic .
it &apos;s not about just five years -- it &apos;s long-term investments .
they had high , or very high , child mortality and family size , six to eight .
this is the report from &#91; the &#93; U.N. , which came out on Friday .
I struggled to &#91; unclear &#93; day was a huge issue .
broke many norms of the standard conventions for the first time .
and therefore , each component had to have a dual functionality .
this is why you started actually a new paradigm shift , where the same people who could not dream of sitting in a car , who were carrying their entire family in a scooter , started dreaming of being in a car .
and I titled this more from less for more and more people as Gandhian engineering .
and that is how Ja@@ ipur Fo@@ ot was created in India .
the Indian cleverness was using its traditional knowledge , however , scientifically vali@@ dating it and making that journey from men to mice to men , not molecule to mice to men , you know .
Joseph Pine on what consumers want
and the question isn &apos;t really so much a question as an ac@@ cu@@ sation .
it &apos;s the only place you ever go for a walk in the woods and all the trees are lined up in rows .
right ? is it really in the city ?
so , the number one thing to do when it comes to being what you say you are , is to provide places for people to experience who you are .
so , I imagined a very simple gest@@ ural dance that would be between a machine and just a very simple chair , and ...
because my job is spectroscopy .
and there are six or seven similar cases reported in the literature .
and this is going to be an instrument to detect Earth-like planets around sun-like stars .
I think it will not come from UFOs .
I wrote a book , I published a theory , but something was not okay -- and what it was is that , if I roughly took the people I interviewed and divided them into people who really have a sense of worthiness -- that &apos;s what this comes down to , a sense of worthiness -- they have a strong sense of love and belonging -- and folks who struggle for it , and folks who are always wondering if they &apos;re good enough .
because about five of my friends were like , &quot; Woo@@ o . I wouldn &apos;t want to be your therapist . &quot;
&quot; I just need some strategies . &quot;
the problem is -- and I learned this from the research -- that you cannot selectively numb emotion .
we do that in our personal lives .
this tracks your activity and also your sleep .
and this is the insight , the thing that we are excited about , because we have gone away from the community that we are , the fact that we really do love each other and want to care for each other .
I don &apos;t even know what a medical record is .
I can &apos;t say whether lithium works in all ALS patients , but I can say whether it works in Humberto .
and it works almost every time .
it was that little outliers there . you see that guy that lived a long time ?
transparency is key .
so one of the very first things we teach people in economics and statistics and business and psychology courses is how , in a statistically valid way , do we eliminate the weir@@ dos .
which is fantastic if I &apos;m trying to find out how many Ad@@ vil the average person should be taking -- two .
which , even at Yale , is extraordinarily rare .
when I went there , I assumed everyone else would see it as a privilege as well , that they &apos;d be excited to be there .
I said , &quot; That &apos;s most people &apos;s Friday nights . &quot;
the Hun@@ dred Girls Project tells us some really nice statistics .
for every 100 girls who are expelled from school , there are 3@@ 35 boys who are expelled from school .
they &apos;re glorified drill and practice .
a game designer from the New School put together a wonderful video gaming school .
they say , &quot; Oh , yeah . they &apos;re always talking about that stuff .
that &apos;s my dad . my dad was kind of like Mac@@ Gy@@ ver , really : he would invent , like , ways to make things heavy .
and when my professors saw this , they were very upset at me .
it &apos;s not like print . it &apos;s not like video .
and I &apos;ll never forget how , like , but -- I &apos;ll never forget how , like , he had a sudden situation with his -- he had an ane@@ ur@@ ys@@ m .

I &apos;m sorry , I &apos;m sorry , Art Center -- Art Center is good , too .
now let &apos;s see it in action .
and mobility to your destination is clearly solved .
... but it strikes me as a slightly unimagin@@ ative way of improving a train journey merely to make it shorter .
the point is that education doesn &apos;t actually work by teaching you things .
how many problems of life can be solved actually by tinkering with perception , rather than that tedious , hardworking and messy business of actually trying to change reality ?
what &apos;s also interesting , if you look at products that have a high component of what you might call messaging value , a high component of intangible value , versus their intrinsic value : they are often quite egalitarian .
now , if we have all these tools at our disposal , we simply have to ask the question , and Thaler and Sun@@ stein have , of how we can use these more intelligently .
you know all about big brains .
because we are self-replicating .
behavioral economist Dan Ariely studies the bugs in our moral code : the hidden reasons we think it &apos;s OK to cheat or steal . clever studies help make his point that we &apos;re predictably irrational -- and can be influenced in ways we can &apos;t grasp .
so , we try to test this .
turns out the people who tried to recall The Ten Commandments -- and in our sample nobody could recall all of The Ten Commandments -- but those people who tried to recall The Ten Commandments , given the opportunity to cheat , did not cheat at all .
and then they took the something else , they walked 12 feet to the side , and exchanged it for dollars .
Donnell Leahy : thank you . I &apos;m kind of new to the TED experience and I &apos;m glad to be here , but I &apos;m just trying to put it all together , trying to figure all you people out , and I &apos;ve been here for a short while , and I &apos;m starting to understand a little bit better .
it &apos;s kind of boring , but I &apos;ll just tell you a little bit about my family . I &apos;m one of 11 brothers and sisters from La@@ ke@@ field , Ontario , an hour and a half northeast of Toronto , and we grew up on a farm .
it &apos;s actually a Scottish piece I &apos;ve chosen .
it became the only piano in the region , and Mom said she could basically play as soon as the piano arrived , she could play it because she had learned all these rhythms . anyway , we found the piano last year and were able to bring it back home . we purchased it .
so one thing that I took from home is this notion that educators don &apos;t necessarily have to teach .
and this is the great team that helped us make it happen .
but we can &apos;t abandon it now ; we have to push forward , get fusion to happen .
but my skin color wasn &apos;t right .
my history wasn &apos;t right .
I can hardly find the words to describe the peace I felt when I was acting .
my desire to disappear was still very powerful .
thank you for listening .
but you just have to go to a garden center , and they &apos;re in little paper packets .
so we realized we had to make a project that would be seeds , some kind of seed cathedral .
and the mayor of Ku@@ ala L@@ um@@ pur said that , if this developer would give something that gave something back to the city , they would give them more gross floor area , buil@@ dable .
and the warden was quite amused , and he told me he thought that I was a nut and he told me , &quot; This place is a correction facility . these guys are serious offenders .
but that &apos;s one reason why they ended up where they were .
I tell kids when they struggle through some uphill and feel like they cannot take it anymore , it really helps to ignore the immediate obstacles and raise your head and look around and see how the vi@@ sta around you grows .
and he goes on saying , and everyone looks at him like a hero , probably for the first time in his life .
students are staying away in droves , universities are disin@@ ve@@ sting in the arts and humanities .
and here &apos;s just one example .
most studies of parenting on which this advice is based are useless . they &apos;re useless because they don &apos;t control for her@@ it@@ ability . they measure some correlation between what the parents do , how the children turn out and assume a causal relation : that the parenting shaped the child .
remember the Malli@@ fer@@ t twins : separated at birth , then they meet in the patent office -- remarkably similar .
I think that the sciences of human nature -- behavioral genetics , evolutionary psychology , neuroscience , cognitive science -- are going to , increasingly in the years to come , upset various dogmas , careers and dee@@ ply-@@ held political belief systems .
lamb goes on the post , she opens it up .
I &apos;m like , this is not a good sign for this lamb , at all .
the way we portray working people on TV -- it &apos;s lau@@ g@@ hable .
and he wasn &apos;t overweight , he was in very good physical shape .
will you come to it ? &quot;
so in wildlife rescue , as in life , we learn from each previous experience , and we learn from both our successes and our failures .
secondly , please create -- please , please create edible landscapes so that our children start to walk past their food day in , day out , on our high streets , in our parks , wherever that might be .
through an organic process , through an increasing recognition of the power of small actions , we are starting , at last , to believe in ourselves again , and to believe in our capacity , each and every one of us , to build a different and a kinder future , and in my book , that &apos;s incredible .
but I got sent to Jerusalem to make a film about early Christianity .
so if religion is not about believing things , what is it about ?
as though that -- we call religious people often believers , as though that were the main thing that they do . and very often , secondary goals get pushed into the first place , in place of compassion and the Golden Rule .
unlike the occup@@ ants of the universe , the universe itself is not wasteful .
but at no point can I react and go , &quot; Ha ! is that the best momen@@ tum@@ -to-@@ energy fourth vector constant you &apos;ve got ? &quot;
Steven We@@ in@@ berg , the Nobel laureate , once said , &quot; The more the universe seems comprehensible , the more it seems pointless . &quot;
but the amazing news was that because they had stood up , these women , and because they had been willing to risk their security , it began a discussion that not only happened in Uganda , but all of Africa .
I just become sk@@ an@@ ky .
very simple stuff .
the goal is not to turn kids into your kind of adult , but rather better adults than you have been , which may be a little challenging considering your guys &apos; credentials .
but of course the scientists couldn &apos;t help themselves .
and in that amount of memory someone programmed a full flight simulation program .
all video games are violent .
of course the newspapers love to beat on this .
I have come to expect this level of interaction .
I know violent video games make my mother worry .
I , however , have a problem very close to home .
in all my driving games , I &apos;ve driven a total of 3@@ 1,@@ 4@@ 59 miles .
it is critical , as these virtual worlds continue to mirror the real world we live in , that game developers realize that they have tremendous responsibilities before them .
I think it &apos;s going to come from the children who are growing up now that aren &apos;t stuck with all of the stuff that we remember from the past .
I &apos;m sitting at the front of the class , and they &apos;re actually pitching their ideas .
and of course , if you &apos;re a speaker here , like Hans Rosling , a speaker finds this complex , tricky . but in Hans Rosling &apos;s case , he had a secret weapon yesterday , literally , in his sword swallowing act .
and these are in the form of sensory apparatus -- telescopes , microscopes -- reasoning apparatus -- various ways of thinking -- and , most importantly , in the ability to change perspective on things .
and we &apos;re still picking up pieces of the Challen@@ ger .
they are really going to come to operate in this realm .
it &apos;s going to drive these things from view .
despite her best efforts , comedian Julia Sweeney is forced to tell a little white lie when her 8@@ -year-old begins learning about frog reproduction -- and starts to ask some very smart questions .
and when she was eight , last year , she was doing a report for school or she had some homework about frogs .
and she goes , &quot; Then how do they get fertilized ? &quot;
and in 1992 I participated in a genetic study and found to my horror , as you can see from the slide , that my ascending aorta was not in the normal range , the green line at the bottom .
so it really is great .
likewise , if you have the artificial valve option , you &apos;re committed to antibiotic therapy whenever you have any intru@@ sive medical treatment at all .
my aorta is fixed , I haven &apos;t got to worry about it , which is a rebirth for me .
so one needs to be careful with disciplinary conventions .
the B@@ rom@@ p@@ ton Hospital was taken over by Imperial College &apos;s School of Medicine , and there are some seriously bad relationship problems between the two organizations .
that &apos;s true .
you don &apos;t want to be the ham in the middle .
you &apos;ll hear more and more about it .
those were poor guys fighting for their rights .
I said , &quot; Well , maybe we don &apos;t have time for this right now . &quot;
I had a girl who came up who said , &quot; My dad says you &apos;re the devil . &quot;
SETI wants there to be stuff out there .
we are right now in the beautiful O@@ re@@ o of existence -- of at least life on Planet Earth -- following the first horrible microbial age .
they really want their world back .
this suggests to me that life causing these mass extinctions because it did is inherently anti-@@ Ga@@ ian .
they take the sediment itself , they extract the oil from it , and from that they can produce compounds which turn out to be very specific to particular microbial groups .
this led Lee K@@ ump , and others from Penn State and my group , to propose what I call the K@@ ump Hy@@ po@@ thesis : many of the mass extinctions were caused by lowering oxygen , by high CO2 . and the worst effect of global warming , it turns out : hydrogen sulfide being produced out of the oceans .
how many of us have gone through our entire Kyoto quota just for flying this year ?
so , what we &apos;re looking at now : does it leave a signal ?
but you lose that contract for a major brand name , that &apos;s the difference between staying in business or going bankrupt .
they have resources , and if we can add the will , the commitment , they know how to deliver that product .
and yes , on a scale from one to over-@@ trusting , I am pretty damn naive .
and that was thanks to a girl in a hoo@@ die .
and that is an amazing realization to have , especially when you &apos;re 14 .
their images fueled resistance to the war and to racism .
I &apos;d like to take you on a visual journey through some of the events and issues I &apos;ve been involved in over the past 25 years .
teenage boys lived in isolation , their bodies covered with white clay .
starvation was being used as a weapon of mass destruction -- primitive but extremely effective .
after the fall of Su@@ har@@ to in Indonesia , I began to explore conditions of poverty in a country that was on its way towards modernization .
it &apos;s when the young couple whisper , &quot; T@@ on@@ ight we are going to make a baby . &quot;
it &apos;s not one of these statistics which is very doub@@ tful .
but there are also countries here like Guatemala , like Papua New Guinea , like Yemen and Afghanistan .
these are the scholars and experts in the government agency in Qatar , and they say the most important factors are : &quot; increased age at first marriage , increased educational level of Q@@ at@@ ari woman and more women integrated in the labor force . &quot;
votes can &apos;t go missing because then you won &apos;t find yours when you look for it .
in the last century , it killed 500 million people .
day eight .
but smallpox was the fourth disease that was intended for eradication .
and it didn &apos;t occur because GPHIN found the pan@@ de@@ mic@@ -to-@@ be of SARS three months before WHO actually announced it , and because of that we were able to stop the SARS pandemic .
I wanted to know if what we human beings see and hear and think is a full and accurate picture of reality .
and it can be sort of craz@@ y-@@ making , housing both the mystic and the warrior in one body .
if you are a Republican , you can take a Democrat to lunch , or if you &apos;re a Democrat , think of it as taking a Republican to lunch .
and it is , for me , a language which expressed the intangible , and gives voice to people and stories without .
his real name is Joshua , and he &apos;s pictured here in a cell where he once used to torture and murder people , including children .
we accompanied Joshua , as he walked the Earth , visiting villages where he had once killed and raped .
and when I asked one of the women about the shock and awe response , she said , &quot; Don &apos;t worry , same thing back home .
sometimes , when the war is over and all the film crews have left , the most inspiring stories are the ones that float just beneath the radar .
and that &apos;s the power of storytelling .
CA : so , what was the impact of that ?
so information that organizations are spending economic effort into conce@@ aling , that &apos;s a really good signal that when the information gets out , there &apos;s a hope of it doing some good -- because the organizations that know it best , that know it from the inside out , are spending work to conceal it .
so late last year -- in November last year -- there was a series of well blow@@ outs in Alban@@ ia , like the well blowout in the Gulf of Mexico , but not quite as big .
so you have to be careful with hacker .
Iceland went through this financial crisis .
and later in biology class , I learned that it &apos;s due to a process called den@@ at@@ uring , which is where the proteins will change shape and lose their ability to chemically function .
and the soy sauce results were in@@ conclusive because of the large data range , but it seems like soy sauce actually increased the potential carcinogens .
now I &apos;m not saying that if you eat grilled chicken that &apos;s not marinated , you &apos;re definitely going to catch cancer and die .
so any user can come in here and click on &quot; lung function report &quot; and it &apos;ll take them to this report that I created .
but before I end my talk today , I want to leave you with one saying .
so I want you to re@@ imagine a world with better air quality , better quality of life and better quality of living for everyone including our future generations .
that was hilarious .
so when it was my turn , I stood up and said , &quot; Why &#91; do &#93; women &apos;s personalities on television always have to be beautiful , sweet , innocent and , you know , supportive ?
and also , the bitterness and even resent@@ ment towards the rich and the powerful is quite widespread .
Aimee Mullins and her 12 pairs of legs
it &apos;s a conversation about potential .
this is a picture of culture .
you &apos;re every step I make ...
common sense here , though , has not yet revol@@ ted in response to this response that the law has offered to these forms of creativity .
I &apos;m instead just going to remind you of the point that BMI teaches us .
and it &apos;s all coming out of things that look like this .
but plants work the same way and insects work the same way , and this apple works the same way .
right ? but , you know , he &apos;s reasonably good looking , but ...
so , you want to know where life is happening ?
and today , of course , you all know that the most productive nation on earth is Luxembourg , producing about one third more wealth per person per year than America .
I watch that TV show &apos; Li@@ e To Me . &apos; I know you &apos;re lying . &quot;
and these alle@@ gations are false .
you can consciously contract the muscles in your cheeks .
they don &apos;t mean anything in and of themselves .
it &apos;s downhill from now on . I wanted to thank Emeka and Chris .
and Tom opens up his lunch box and there &apos;s rice in it , and he goes on this rant about , &quot; Tw@@ enty years , my wife has been packing rice for lunch .
please stop ! &quot;
the fact that it happens in &quot; Another Country &quot; takes you quite by surprise .
he also says that the cause of all our trouble is the belief in an essential , pure identity : religious , ethnic , historical , ideological .
these are a -- this is like a 15 million dollar line .
and they go , &quot; Oh , that &apos;s really nice , &quot; and out it goes .
I used to be in the film business , kind of , and actually , Nicholas Negroponte saw this when I was , like , 12 , and anyway , so then they said , &quot; No , you have to make two and they have to fight . &quot;
that &apos;s David Let@@ ter@@ man .
this is a -- you can see the little window there .
you get one out of 20 , one out of 30 products .
there &apos;s another one .
so the challenge was -- I worked for Microsoft for a little bit , working on the Microsoft Bar@@ ney .
there &apos;s my first exploded view and all the little pieces and the little worm drive and all that stuff .
that &apos;s good , wake up , wake up , wake up .
and when I meet the mothers in so many of these remote places , I &apos;m really struck by the things that we have in common .
and so they took a bit of time to learn about that .
well , they didn &apos;t stop there -- they localized it into 18 different languages .
I &apos;m going to tell you two things today : one is what we have lost , and two , a way to bring it back .
this is grou@@ per sex , and the groupers aggregate around the full moons of December and January for a week .
the estimated range is between 20 and 50 percent for a series of goals of biodiversity and fishery enhancement and resilience .
but at least on coral reefs are systems where there is a bottom component with structure .
so first , five symptoms that you &apos;re doing math reasoning wrong in your classroom .
first things first , we eliminate all the sub@@ steps .
so now we have the real deal .
that &apos;s how you know you &apos;ve ba@@ ited the hook , right ?
I get emails still from teachers in countries I &apos;ve never visited saying , &quot; Wow , yeah . we had a good conversation about that .
it &apos;s one of my favorites , because it &apos;s got all sorts of working parts .
but see all those different working things ?
this is kind of like an undersea rooster .
DG : I think that &apos;s one of the greatest stories right now that we &apos;re seeing from the bottom of the sea , is that the first thing we see coming out of the sea floor after a volcanic eruption is bacteria .
there &apos;s a whole story being played out here that we &apos;re just now beginning to have some idea of because of this new camera technology .
BL : you see this white V-@@ shaped mark on the back of the shrimp ?
that &apos;s probably where we evolved from .
you &apos;re talking about bio@@ densities and biodiversity , again , higher than the rainforest that just springs back to life .
and so education needs to work by pull , not push .
and so the idea of a curriculum is completely irrelevant in a setting like this .
but you find ways to get learning that &apos;s relevant to people through technology , people and places that are different .
and he was finally brought back into school , not by the offer of G@@ C@@ SE@@ s , but by the offer of learning how to become a carpenter , a practical making skill .
there are Chinese restaurants everywhere , but there is no Chinese restaurant chain .
so that &apos;s why we need three more kinds of innovation .
they &apos;re recogn@@ iz@@ ably schools , but they look different .
the most exciting is the Harlem Children &apos;s Zone , which over 10 years , led by Geoffrey Canada , has , through a mixture of schooling and family and community projects , attempted to transform not just education in schools , but the entire culture and aspiration of about 10,000 families in Harlem .
and we are be@@ qu@@ ea@@ thing to the developing world school systems that they will now spend a century trying to reform .
some of it , obviously , is genetic .
there are markings on many plants that look like other insects .
now dece@@ it carries on through the plant kingdom .
they fly into this thing , and they fly all the way down it .
and it &apos;s visualizing SMS messages being sent in the city of Amsterdam .
I think there &apos;s something really interesting to watching people as they go through this creative to@@ il -- something we can all relate to , this creative process of trying to come up with something from nothing .
and there &apos;s this reference to &quot; Le Pe@@ tit Prince &quot; where the narrator asks the prince to draw a sheep .
chorus : ♫ Daisy , Daisy ♫ ♫ Give me your answer do ♫ ♫ I &apos;m half crazy ♫ ♫ all for the love of you ♫ ♫ It can &apos;t be a stylish marriage ♫ ♫ I can &apos;t afford a carriage ♫ ♫ But you &apos;d look sweet upon the seat ♫ ♫ of a bicycle built for two ♫ AK : so stepping back for a quick second , when I was at UCLA going to grad school , I was also working at a place called the Center for Em@@ bed@@ ded Network Sen@@ sing .
&quot; mad Gro@@ w@@ th on Columbus Circle . &quot;
but I added weather@@ van@@ es on both sides to show that they cover all directions .
so for the subway in New York , I saw a correspondence between riding the subway and reading .
is this an envelope we &apos;re living inside of , or no , does it go onto infinity in both time and space ?
I couldn &apos;t wait to prove the athlete I am , that nobody else in the world can do this swim .
and I reminded myself a couple hours in , you know , the sport is sort of a micro@@ cos@@ m of life itself .
and they can send the poison into the system .
there are more suici@@ des in developed individualistic countries than in any other part of the world .
this idea that everybody deserves to get where they get to , I think it &apos;s a crazy idea , completely crazy .
what I think I &apos;ve been talking about really is success and failure .
if I said to you that there is somebody behind the screen who is very very successful , certain ideas would immediately come to mind .
you would think that person might have made a lot of money , achieved ren@@ own in some field .
Eric Top@@ ol says we &apos;ll soon use our smartphones to monitor our vital signs and chronic conditions . at TEDMED , he highlights several of the most important wireless devices in medicine &apos;s future -- all helping to keep more of us out of hospital beds .
OK . so , that &apos;s the first night .
the plot of the book is that there &apos;s not enough diversity , so that the people who designed the city make sure that every now and then an entirely new person is created .
I went to chef school in France .
this shaped wok doesn &apos;t work very well ; this caught fire three times .
in addition to cu@@ ta@@ ways , we also explain physics .
so as you move vertically away from this surface , the heat falls off .
what is astonishing about this is , even though we don &apos;t know really how much of this was intended to be religious , or how much of it was intended to be therapeutic , what we can tell is that these patients lived !
and it really changed the landscape of surgery .
and we can leave the patient whole and intact and functional afterwards .
this is about people who can not walk away , people who are forced to work without pay , people who are operating 24 / 7 under a threat of violence and have no pay .
we &apos;re not about to run out of people . no other commodity has that .
well , first , before I even tell you the cost I &apos;ve got to be absolutely clear .
so that was just a little sni@@ p .
you &apos;ve got to create a system that will work better and better .
very simple . it &apos;s just a start . but it &apos;s that lear@@ n-@@ by-@@ doing thing .
so my point is that this scope of vision , this holistic vision of design , was with them from the beginning .
Charles Eames : in India , those without , and the lowest in caste , eat very often , particularly in southern India , they eat off of a banana leaf .
Ed : I &apos;ve been looking forward to sharing that quote with you .
and it &apos;s kind of cool for me to be part of a family and a tradition where he was talking about that in 1978 .
now , it &apos;s quite an old phenomenon ; it was discovered 100 years ago .
now , this is not just levitation . it &apos;s not just repulsion .
for example , I can make a large circular rail here .
now -- -- So we now know that we are able to transfer enormous amount of currents inside superconductors , so we can use them to produce strong magnetic fields , such as needed in MRI machines , particle accelerators and so on .
imagine you could back up a single power station with a single superconducting cable .
I didn &apos;t have the rest of my life to do this project .
we &apos;ll see the same thing in the economic recession we &apos;re having now .
I was a little nervous because maybe the data wouldn &apos;t be right , but I &apos;ve done this now for 30 years , and it has stayed on this exponential progression .
but where will we get the software ?
the last third of the nine-@@ week intensive summer session will be devoted to a group project to address some major challenge of humanity .
and , you know , if you think about this with the tsunami , what you have is essentially a kind of an army of local journalists , who are producing enormous amounts of material for no reason other than to tell their stories .
and it can &apos;t be done .
it &apos;s going to go inside something that we use in CAT scans and MR@@ Is of whatever is their good arm , to make silicon rubber , then coat it , and paint it in 3D -- exact mirror image of their other limb .
it is the landscape , right ?
I &apos;ve heard what I consider an extraordinary thing that I &apos;ve only heard a little bit in the two previous TEDs , and what that is is an inter@@ weaving and an inter@@ lar@@ ding , an inter@@ mixing , of a sense of social responsibility in so many of the talks -- global responsibility , in fact , appealing to enlightened self-interest , but it goes far beyond enlightened self-interest .
so , the lesson is very clear . the lesson is that our patient -- the world , and the disadvantaged of the world -- that patient deserves our compassion .
remember , I have been talking about , essentially philanthropy : the love of humankind , the individual humankind and the individual humankind that can bring that kind of love translated into action , translated , in some cases , into enlightened self-interest .
but apart from that , everything else goes through contractions of muscles .
and I think if IBM &apos;s Deep Blue played anyone in this room , it would win every time .
if you &apos;re playing against a very good opponent , they may distribute it in that green area , which is the prior distribution , making it hard for you to return .
so if I take some dots and set them in motion with biological motion , your brain &apos;s circuitry would understand instantly what &apos;s going on .
there are many diseases which effect movement .
whatever .
and it &apos;s pretty amazing actually .
I was afraid a car was going to come smash it as I was taking a picture for you guys .
we pre@@ program it .
there &apos;s actually no hon@@ or@@ arium for anyone for this thing .
for this climate crisis , we assembled a network , really , of super@@ stars , from policy activists to scientists and entrepreneurs and business leaders . fifty or so of them .
it does seem really hard to get consumers to do the right thing .
so , Brazil &apos;s ethanol miracle , I &apos;m really afraid , is not enough .
and , in fact , this idea can be used not just to predict epidemics of germs , but also to predict epidemics of all sorts of kinds .
imagine a very popular person in the social network -- like a party host who has hundreds of friends -- and a mis@@ anth@@ rope who has just one friend , and you pick someone at random from the population ; they were much more likely to know the party host .
and we did this passively by looking at whether or not they &apos;d gone to university health services .
and the difference in the two is 16 days .
information spreads in populations , norms can spread in populations , behaviors can spread in populations .
with two mirrors , the scanner calculates the beam &apos;s horizontal and vertical angles , giving accurate x , y , and z coordinates .
of course , earthquakes and all the natural phenomena -- floods , tornadoes , etc . -- take their toll .
all I can tell you is that in my congres@@ sional office in Colorado and my office in Washington , we &apos;re getting hundreds and hundreds of calls about the endangered ape and gorilla population in Rwanda , but nobody is calling about the people .
and the students and the others who are part of this incredibly energized base are there to answer that , and there &apos;s always something to do .
do you turn off the international spigot of life support and risk two million civilian lives ?
don &apos;t you see it &apos;s unacceptable what you &apos;re doing ?
we put people on humanitarian aid and we boast about it because we &apos;ve spent three billion .
we have reason to be afraid of melting ice caps .
I mean , such an acute awareness of how hard it was .
there &apos;s going to be a lot of people .
one two years earlier had killed more than a million people .
so why is it that we have a billion people who can &apos;t find food ?
families need the help .
or if they get an extra ration of food at the end of the week -- it costs about 50 cents -- will keep a girl in school , and they &apos;ll give birth to a healthier child , because the malnutrition is sent generation to generation .
we now deliver food in over 30 countries over cell phones , transforming even the presence of refugees in countries , and other ways .
I am so honored to be here with some of the world &apos;s top innovators and thinkers .
so , our dictionary for describing cancer is very , very poor .
in the next month , the end of December , you &apos;ll see ovarian cancer , and then lung cancer will come several months after .
the website says , &quot; If you look , there &apos;s an individual mutation , and maybe a second , and maybe a third , and that is cancer . &quot;
it &apos;s what we call a system .
it &apos;s used to treat oste@@ op@@ or@@ osis , and they got that twice a year .
I mean , this is a scary slide , not to take an aside , but it looks at obesity in the world .
so this is a woman , 46 years old , who had recurrent lung cancer .
so it challenged everything we knew in cancer , is that you don &apos;t need to get a response .
it &apos;s taking a big picture .
sounds are affecting your hormone secre@@ tions all the time , but also your breathing , your heart rate -- which I just also did -- and your brainwaves .
it &apos;s not just unpleasant sounds like that that do it .
for those of you who are retailers , you may want to look away before I show this slide .
they are all important . and every brand needs to have guidelines at the center .
so I think , unfortunately , a lot of neuroscientists , we &apos;re all somewhat narcissistic .
and I would propose it &apos;s not a fair metric .
you can let the fly play a little video game by letting it fly around in a visual display .
our mission is to build a detailed , realistic computer model of the human brain .
and when you think of the fabric of the brain , the structure , how is it built ? what is the pattern of the carpet ?
and your neurons are not going to be oriented and positioned in exactly the same way .
so it &apos;s very unlikely that you got the same fabric , the same circuitry .
a month ago today I stood there : 90 degrees south , the top of the bottom of the world , the Geographic South Pole .
I mean , first you have to know that you &apos;ve got a problem .
this took place in my childhood -- 1957 to &apos; 65 .
this is trajectories going to Mars ; all this was done by hand with slide rules .
so , they had a lot of fun doing this . but no children were allowed ; my dad could tell me he was building a spaceship and going to go to Saturn , but he could not say anything more about it .
results : none .
and the title for my cookbook was going to be &quot; D@@ ining Without C@@ rum@@ bs : the Art of E@@ ating Over the S@@ ink . &quot;
so I can put some lines on ; it doesn &apos;t help .
I want you to think about illusion as a metaphor .
turns out that they got to 28 percent after mailing every household in the country a letter begging people to join this organ donation program .
or you could get both for 125 .
but for some reason when it comes to the mental world , when we design things like healthcare and retirement and stock@@ markets , we somehow forget the idea that we are limited .
and radio waves are limited .
infrared -- due to eye safety regulations , can be only used with low power .
and in the middle there , we have this visible light spectrum .
and that signal is then converted back to a high-speed data stream .
Barry Schul@@ er : genomics 101
it &apos;s long and it &apos;s complicated .
when you &apos;re seeing these pictures , it &apos;s all ones and zeros , and when you &apos;re talking on your telephone , your cell phone , and it &apos;s going over the network , your voice is all being turned into ones and zeros and magically whiz@@ zed around .
we now understand that those microbes have more impact on our climate and regulating CO2 and oxygen than plants do , which we always thought oxygen@@ ate the atmosphere .
this is not big news to vi@@ ticul@@ tur@@ ists ; they have been , you know , concerned with water and fertiliz@@ ation .
all we have to do is go around and sample , dig into the ground , find those bugs , sequence them , correlate them to the kinds of characteristics we like and don &apos;t like -- that &apos;s just a big database -- and then fertilize .
like , &quot; Oh , I &apos;m sorry you had to beat me . I &apos;m really sorry , yes , it &apos;s my fault . &quot;
and people say , &quot; Well , I don &apos;t know , to sit , I guess . &quot;
not necessarily , no .
one , it is the lateral stability for the entire building ; it is a structural element . but its dimensions were designed not only for structure , but also for holding on every piece of glass .
theater is really focused in New York , Chicago and Seattle , with the exception of the Dallas Theater Company . &quot;
OK , it seems a very formal , will@@ ful gesture , but something derived entirely out of the constraints .
so , we begin by building the cores .
Chris asked me to add -- the theater is under construction , and this project will start construction in about a year , and finish in 2010 .
♫ When I wake up ♫ ♫ in the morning ♫ ♫ I pour the coffee ♫ ♫ I read the paper ♫ ♫ And then I slowly ♫ ♫ and so softly ♫ ♫ do the dishes ♫ ♫ So feed the fishes ♫ ♫ You sing me happy birthday ♫ ♫ Like it &apos;s gonna be ♫ ♫ your last day ♫ ♫ here on Earth ♫ All right .
it &apos;s kind of cool . S@@ ong@@ writers can sort of get away with murder .
CA : Wow . William , it &apos;s a real honor to have you at the TED conference .
thank you so much for coming .
and in the right-hand corner , you don &apos;t have to calculate anything .
I &apos;m assuming there are not many people here who speak Icelandic .
they yield to the slightest movement or motion or emotion .
so in these few minutes , I hope I &apos;ve been able to share a little bit of my vision of things and to show you that words can have colors and emotions , numbers , shapes and personalities .
global famine was inevitable .
no other animal does it .
people forget that . people think of trade as a modern thing .
OK , so that &apos;s what we did , but how are we going to do that ?
you can &apos;t control real people , as you probably know .
and we know who &apos;s got defects in R@@ NA@@ SE@@ L and who doesn &apos;t .
is it really in the tissue ? and I &apos;ll end up with this : yes .
and as we start growing the camera will actually start zooming out , and things that you see in the background there will actually start slowly pulling into the foreground , showing you a little bit of what you &apos;ll be interacting with as you grow .
&quot; for two minutes , &quot; you say , &quot; I want you to stand like this , and it &apos;s going to make you feel more powerful . &quot;
a couple more .
so you can be standing or you can be sitting .
so this is what &apos;s driving the effect , or medi@@ ating the effect .
starting with the simple tale of an ant , philosopher Dan Dennett unleashes a devastating sal@@ vo of ideas , making a powerful case for the existence of memes -- concepts that are literally alive .
you know spi@@ der@@ webs ? sure , they are products of evolution .
I say , &quot; Well , do words exist ? are they in your ontology ? &quot;
that will encourage the spread of relatively benign mutations of the most toxic varieties .
I am a conductor , and I &apos;m here today to talk to you about trust .
and that showed me such a fundamental truth , that music making and other forms of creativity can so often go to places where mere words cannot .
one of them was &quot; Carmen . &quot;
so I decided to create a platform for that potential .
and it had fuzzy ze@@ bras walking across the stomach , and Mount Kilimanjaro and Mount Mer@@ u were kind of right across the chest , that were also fuzzy .
and it was that -- that whole philosophy -- that encouraged me to start my current endeavor called &quot; Acumen Fund , &quot; which is trying to build some mini-@@ blueprints for how we might do that in water , health and housing in Pakistan , India , Kenya , Tanzania and Egypt .
here are just some pictures of the factory .
today , three years later , the company has employed another thousand women .
if she were born anywhere else but Tanzania , I &apos;m telling you , she could run Wall Street .
I was curious about them and about the way in which they resolve conflict .
stories are what we use to transmit knowledge .
in a phrase , it &apos;s : 4,000 years ago , a man and his family walked across the Middle East , and the world has never been the same since .
that &apos;s the essence of the Abraham path .
so we developed the Angel@@ Med Guardian System and we have a device inside this patient , called the Im@@ planted Angel@@ Med Guardian .
then it goes to a network operations center , where they get your data from your patient database that &apos;s been put in at some central location , say , in the United States .
anchor : for anyone who suffers from migraine headaches -- and there are 30 million Americans who do -- tonight : a possible answer .
the device could be implanted under the scalp to be totally hidden and avoid wire break@@ age , which occurs if you put it in the chest and you try to move your neck around .
for example , I asked the epilepsy people what are they using for informed consent .
well , press the button and you &apos;re on record , you understand .
so I &apos;m here to tell you a story of success from Africa .
this is the Twitter reports for over three days just covering Mumbai .
from young , smart developers .
anyone in the world is allowed to rip or copy musical ideas , use them in innovative ways .
OK , burn , I think this is sort of , quite interesting .
not just text , but music , images , video , and there &apos;s actually a tremendous uptake of the number of people that are actually licensing music to make it free for people who do this whole idea of re-@@ sampling , rip , mixing , burning and sharing .
because we &apos;re saying that anybody can contribute things to this commons . anybody can contribute anything .
Nicholas Negroponte , founder of the MIT Media Laboratory , describes how the One Laptop Per Child project will build and distribute the &quot; $ 100 laptop . &quot;
and that &apos;s why scale counts .
it worked really well .
well , on December 12 , a company called Qu@@ ant@@ a agreed to build it , and since they make about one-third of all the laptops on the planet today , that question disappeared .
that came from a 1960 paper on space travel , because , if you think about it , space is pretty awkward .
notice that there are only some objects that he can see , whereas there are many more objects that you can see .
so it &apos;s the test a mother gets when she comes in .
the second : keep mothers healthy , keep mothers alive , keep the children alive -- no more orphans .
I &apos;ve been afraid to tell everybody . &quot;
and you see where this is going .
I tell them , &quot; You are going to make it , and you will raise a healthy baby . &quot;
Mitchell B@@ esser : remember the images I showed you of how few doctors and nurses there are in Africa .
it was at that point , just the spark of an idea .
past patients taking care of present patients .
yet almost all the corn we eat has been altered genetically in some way .
I want you to know that I believe kids will eat fresh vegetables and good food if they know more about it and where it really comes from .
business class morality is , don &apos;t bomb Japan -- they built my car .
all right , now these are the wh@@ a -- I &apos;d say , &#91; mumble , mumble -- mumble , mumble , mumble , mumble , mumble &#93; -- ahh !
now -- one of the things that is very important to me is to try and figure out what on Earth am I here for .
let me turn the trails on , so you can see that a little bit better .
uses very , very little power .
so where are the Phoenix Islands ?
but tell me where they are and the country that owns them . &quot;
after I got back , I said , okay , this is amazing , what we found .
and , you know , it didn &apos;t seem like a very good deal to me .
so I asked the Minister over dinner , I said , &quot; Would you consider a situation where you would still get paid -- we do the math and figure out what the value of the resource is -- but you leave fish and the sharks and the shrimp in the water ? &quot;
so , according to this , the Australians and the Japanese as well as the Mexicans are very happy .
and , you know , my studio -- we &apos;ve done it all the time .
this is at P@@ .S. 1 -- a sculpture that &apos;s basically a square room by James Tur@@ re@@ ll , that has a re@@ trac@@ table ceiling .
now there are two groups that exist within the Muslim world .
and she said , &quot; Show me . &quot; so I showed this .
as a psychologist , I worry for the world in general , but worry about the perception of how people see themselves in my part of the world .
I left Bel@@ le@@ v@@ ue , went to business school and started this .
any boys and girls caught flir@@ ting would get married off immediately , okay .
and it mush@@ ro@@ omed slightly . Afghanistan and Iraq mush@@ ro@@ omed now to 3,000 billion .
let me point them out .
I wonder if I could make my life beautiful .
I &apos;m not quite sure I &apos;ve succeeded .
because America is an incredibly rich country .
now the good news is , B@@ oran@@ es you can get hold of .
this is a real thing .
on the third children &apos;s home , at 15 , I started to rebel , and what I did was , I got three t@@ ins of paint , Air@@ fix paint that you use for models , and I was -- it was a big children &apos;s home , big Victorian children &apos;s home -- and I was in a little turret at the top of it , and I poured them , red , yellow and green , the colors of Africa , down the tiles .
I was born in Britain , as you have probably guessed .
and one of the other things I &apos;d been interested in and obsessed with over the years is spines and skeletons , having collected a couple of hundred .
now , this is funny for me : to fall in love with an object from a Hammett novel , because if it &apos;s true that the world is divided into two types of people , Chandler people and Hammett people , I am absolutely a Chandler person .
this is the &quot; K@@ ni@@ pha@@ us@@ en Haw@@ k . &quot;
now , here &apos;s the most recent progression of Fal@@ cons .
that is the big question .
just to put this in terms of generations , because people do find it hard to think of time , Homo erectus left Africa 90,000 generations ago .
I &apos;ll leave it at that , thank you very much .
so raise your straws if you &apos;ll join me .
and so I &apos;ve worked with computer image analysis engineers to develop automatic recognition systems that can identify these animals and then extract the X@@ Y@@ Z coordinate of the initial impact point .
and this fish , which is one of my favorites , has three headlights on each side of its head .
so , most animals make blue light , and most animals can only see blue light , but this fish is a really fascinating exception because it has two red light organs .
and we know a little bit more about bioluminescence thanks to Pixar , and I &apos;m very grateful to Pixar for sharing my favorite topic with so many people .
so I &apos;m holding it , and I &apos;m about to touch that tube on its shoulder , and when I do , you &apos;ll see bioluminescence coming out .
and I defy you to name any other branch of science that still depends on hundreds of year-old technology .
and Sylvia has said that we are destroying the oceans before we even know what &apos;s in them , and she &apos;s right .
when I look at these things , they look pretty normal to me .
my office is a mixture of the Natural History Museum and a NASA space lab .
if he was a car designer , phew , we &apos;d all be driving one .
if you see the shadows that come through that , they &apos;re actually probably more important than the product , but it &apos;s the minimum it takes .
I &apos;ve had this image of a water droplet for 20 years sitting on a hot bed .
it &apos;s a bio-@@ poly@@ carbonate new chair I &apos;m doing in Italy .
as you probably know , in science , when you write a kind of special paper , only six or seven people read it .
for example , this is the sound of grass .
so I &apos;ve been hearing color all the time for eight years , since 2004 , so I find it completely normal now to hear color all the time .
the BBC bee@@ ps , they sound turquoise , and listening to Mozart became a yellow experience , so I started to paint music and paint people &apos;s voices , because people &apos;s voices have frequencies that I relate to color .
as we saw with the teacher in Cody , Wyoming , she seems to be affected by the law .
then , just staying above the Earth for one more second , people are acting like idiots , all across the country .
it &apos;s actually not very hard . Ninety-@@ eight percent of cases , this is a piece of cake .
wise people know how to improvise .
so I &apos;ll give you an example of wise practice in action .
it was a toy gun .
and so she improvised a sentence -- 11 months , and not only that , but release every day to go to work .
they are very dedicated and committed .
part of the problem is that the emergency planners themselves , personally , are overwhelmed psychologically by the thought of nuclear catastrophe .
and if you &apos;re wearing clothing , you &apos;ve taken off your clothing , you &apos;re going to get showered down some place and remove the radiation that would be -- the radioactive material that might be on you .
and then you see something like that .
so once you start looking and looking at smaller and smaller things -- so this particular person wrote a whole article and said , &quot; Hey , these are bacteria . &quot;
well how would you go about it ?
and that explains why that NASA manager was actually in my office to begin with .
because if we can , maybe we have a chance of actually discovering life somewhere else without being biased by things like amino acids . &quot;
so here would be a frequency plot of how often you find each of the 26 letters of the alphabet in a text written by random monkeys .
and if you have a system where they &apos;re being replaced one by the other , it &apos;s like the monkeys writing on a typewriter .
so the first thing that we learn is that it is possible to define life in terms of processes alone , without referring at all to the type of things that we hold dear , as far as the type of life on Earth is .
granted , it &apos;s limited , but we have learned what it takes in order to actually construct it .
sand , water , all the equipment we don &apos;t need anymore .
this can be in environment , in finance , in education of children .
I don &apos;t think it will transport 200 people in the next years .
this is why all the people who believe in this type of spirit are welcome to be on that team .
just as we cannot ignore the literal meaning of words , we cannot ignore the analogies that are triggered by metaphor .
and the only way to find out about the latter is to investigate the ways it might be like the former .
so , the original meaning of &quot; cogito &quot; is to shake together .
my lower half is appearing at a different conference in a different country .
even the poorest neighborhoods give more than they can afford .
the problems facing the developing world afford us in the developed world a chance to re-@@ describe ourselves to the world .
but think about it .
give them permission , if you like , to spend their political capital and your financial capital , your national purse on saving the lives of millions of people .
okay , my three wishes .
I &apos;ve been to Ethiopia , as I said earlier .
it was just nine years later that Add@@ is A@@ baba was connected by phone to Har@@ are , which is 500 kilometers away .
na : well , let me first warn you that I &apos;m not the traditional Yemeni girl .
it &apos;s almost , &quot; Do your homework , &quot; -- some involvement .
so I moved to Baltimore to be near my doctors and enrolled in a conser@@ vatory nearby .
Tyrone Hayes + Penelope Ja@@ ge@@ s@@ sar Cha@@ ffer : the toxic baby ?
Penelope Ja@@ ge@@ s@@ sar Cha@@ ffer : I was going to ask if there &apos;s a doctor in the house .
in fact , this aromatase is so important in breast cancer that the latest treatment for breast cancer is a chemical called le@@ tro@@ z@@ ole , which blocks aromatase , blocks estrogen , so that if you developed a mutated cell , it doesn &apos;t grow into a tumor .
half of each year &apos;s 100 billion points of thermal plastic pellets will be made into fast-@@ track trash .
in spite of deposit fees , much of this trash leading out to the sea will be plastic be@@ verage bottles .
we cleaned up the swa@@ ths of beach shown .
so I wrote a letter .
the first thing that we see is we see black-and-white cur@@ bing , which is handy because we &apos;ve seen that before .
so what does that tell me ? I &apos;ve got to go back now to my three sources and look at what they told me : the one who said the bridge didn &apos;t exist , the one who said the bridge wasn &apos;t in Hama , and the one guy who said , &quot; Yes , the bridge does exist , but I &apos;m not sure about the water levels . &quot;
and with a friend of his , he took it upon himself to free-@@ climb a Redwood without ropes or any equipment to see what was up there .
and then , from there , he climbed directly up the bark until he got to the top of the tree .
it &apos;s as big as any of the biggest trees east of the Mississippi River , and yet it &apos;s only a minor feature on Chron@@ os .
these copepods are a major constitu@@ ent of the oceans , and they are a major part of the diet of grazing baleen whales .
Mik@@ ko Hyp@@ pon@@ en : fighting viruses , defending the net
so let me show you something .
I asked them why .
what we have here in the background is an example of our systems that we run in our labs , where we track virus infections worldwide .
this is a website operating in Moscow where these guys are buying infected computers .
here , I &apos;m looking at the Hex dump of an image file , which contains an exploit .
but things are also changing at a very rapid pace .
a lot of people are worried about what is rationality about ?
mother Ther@@ esa , she was rational .
there &apos;s a good reason that we don &apos;t do that , and there &apos;s a good reason that using game theory and computers , we can overcome the limitation of just looking at a few people .
most people fall in between , and if we can work out where they fall we can work out how to negotiate with them to change their behavior .
what is your motive for action ?
so , I &apos;ve had an obsession basically for 30 years , and that obsession has been , &quot; What makes the difference in the quality of peoples lives ?
and what I mean by that is the mindset that we are our past .
so really , we &apos;re going to remind ourselves that decision is the ultimate power . that &apos;s what it really is .
you can do it by getting yourself in a situation where you put more tattoos and earrings in places humans don &apos;t want to know .
whatever it takes . the fastest way to do this , if you have no background , no culture , no belief and resources or resource@@ fulness , is violence . if I put a gun to your head and I live in the &apos; hood , instantly I &apos;m significant .
second -- but this is what changed my life , this is what shaped me as a human being -- &quot; Some@@ body &apos;s gift .
it &apos;s the only way our world &apos;s going to change . God bless you .
so , if you &apos;re in the audience today , or maybe you &apos;re watching this talk in some other time or place , you are a participant in the digital rights ecosystem .
the next movement is called mobs .
one of the things that I &apos;m really , really happy to be able to show you here today is our virtual autopsy table .
it &apos;s a little mechanical pen that has very , very fast step motors inside of the pen .
and here it is . here is the nose of the bear .
and after that -- there &apos;s nothing much to say about that .
and apart from a few very important loose ends , which you &apos;ve heard about here -- like dark energy and dark matter -- this equation describes , seems to describe everything about the universe and what &apos;s in it .
we live in one of these worlds , and I can only show it as a sheet , but it &apos;s really three-dimensional .
I won &apos;t go into the details of why we think the universe is like this , but it comes out of the math and trying to explain the physics that we know .
and if they collide , it would look a lot like the Big Bang .
we &apos;ve shown that it can fit all of the data that we have about the formation of galaxies , the fluctuations in the microwave background .
and this was very eloquently argued at TED Africa : that all of the aid that &apos;s been given has completely failed to put Africa onto its own two feet .
after leaving AIMS , I went on to do a master &apos;s in applied mathematics at the University of Cape Town in South Africa .
and second , it gives us the opportunity to understand how these supermassive black holes interact with their environment , and to understand how they affect the formation and evolution of the galaxies which they reside in .
and we call them active galactic nuclei .
so , you can &apos;t see the black hole itself , but you can convert the gravitational energy of the black hole into the light we see .
and this is a wide field picture taken of the center of the Milky Way .
it &apos;s all the an@@ the@@ ms and dance cra@@ zes and bal@@ lads and marches .
they &apos;re locations in the spectrum of sound .
to me this is the intimate , personal side of music .
he came over to a piano that was there , and he balanced himself and began playing something like this .
then of course , at the dawn of aviation , all of the great inventors of the time -- like Har@@ gre@@ a@@ ves , like Langley , even Alexander Graham Bell , inventor of the telephone , who was flying this kite -- were doing so in the pursuit of aviation .
the majority of it is in the higher altitudes , above 300 feet , where we don &apos;t have a technology as yet to get there .
your C@@ ess@@ na would be 2@@ 30 kil@@ lo@@ watts .
this is a refrigerator factory , churning out airplanes for World War II .
well , I think it &apos;s the latest iteration of a phenomenon we can call &quot; crowd-accelerated innovation . &quot;
you can think of them as three dials on a giant wheel .
they used the same trash to form green manure .
the same trash site is feeding more than 30 families .
now , to make this more concrete , let &apos;s look at the list of top 10 words that statistically stick out in the most favorite TEDTalks and in the least favorite TEDTalks .
it &apos;s perfectly fine .
now , let &apos;s go to the visuals .
there was even a story recently that scientists had thought about actually replacing rats in their experiments with politicians .
this , I think , is the most important fact to bear in mind in British politics or American politics , and that is : we have run out of money .
just consider this one fact : one hundred years ago , sending these 10 words cost 50 dollars .
in this country , if we win the election , we are going to make all government spending over 25,000 pounds transparent and available online , searchable for anyone to see .
that sort of behavioral economics can transform people &apos;s behavior in a way that all the bullying and all the information and all the bad@@ gering from a government cannot possibly achieve .
none of my previous experience prepared me for what came next . can you guess ?
why not personal biotech ?
so we said , let &apos;s start with that neighborhood cell .
and we thought that basking sharks were temperate animals and only lived in our latitude .
and that &apos;s why it &apos;s great to have collaboration .
they found that there was no genetic differentiation between any of the world &apos;s oceans of basking sharks .
I became an expert witness for one of the guards , Serge@@ ant Chip Frederick , and in that position , I had access to the dozen investigative reports .
what was he doing in that prison rather than in some mental institution ?
if they don &apos;t change their appearance , only one of eight kills , tor@@ tures or mutil@@ ates .
when I said it got out of control , I was the prison superintendent .
and you &apos;re on one side or the other .
evil , meaning you &apos;re going to be Arthur Andersen .
you &apos;re going to cheat , or you &apos;re going to allow bullying .
the wonder is about the fact that we all woke up this morning and we had with it the amazing return of our conscious mind .
well first of all , it is a mind , which is a flow of mental images .
so now I &apos;m going to show you a picture .
they &apos;re there because there &apos;s this very close interaction .
only the wealth of our minds is , not the very fact that we have a self that we can refer to our own existence , and that we have any sense of person .
my parents were radic@@ als -- who became , well , grown-ups .
this is not a fake .
and he turned to my mother , and he said , &quot; You haven &apos;t told her yet ? &quot;
but very quickly I recovered . it was like that .
and I kept thinking over and over in my mind , what had happened ? where did it go wrong ? why didn &apos;t I understand ?
I didn &apos;t speak Hindi . I &apos;d never been to India . hadn &apos;t a clue .
nine months later , after that day on s@@ not rock , I had the only blind date in my life with a seven and a half foot elephant called K@@ anch@@ i .
and I have learned , you know what , cars and motor@@ bikes and elephants , that &apos;s not freedom .
in James Howard Kun@@ stler &apos;s view , public spaces should be inspired centers of civic life and the physical manifestation of the common good . instead , he argues , what we have in America is a nation of places not worth caring about .
the street trees have really four jobs to do and that &apos;s it : to spati@@ ally denote the pedestrian realm , to protect the pedestrians from the vehicles in the carri@@ a@@ ge@@ way , to filter the sunlight onto the sidewalk , and to sof@@ ten the hard@@ scape of the buildings and to create a ceiling -- a vaul@@ ted ceiling -- over the street , at its best .
we can see some of the first ideas for retro-@@ fitting some of the catastrophic property that we have in America .
they &apos;re not going to be retro-@@ fitted ; they &apos;re going to be the sal@@ vage yards of the future .
secrets can remind us of the countless human dra@@ mas , of fra@@ il@@ ty and heroism , playing out silently in the lives of people all around us even now .
Matty invites people to mail him digital cameras that they &apos;ve found , memory sticks that have been lost with orphan photos .
thank you for making your site .
and so I think we can roll the video that we have .
but music is even more powerful if you don &apos;t just listen to it , but you make it yourself .
so he can use his infrared tracker to go directly into Hyperscore .
so that &apos;s the way he made his piece , and as Adam says , we then figured out the best way to have him perform his piece .
this includes the little system in Arabic called al-@@ je@@ bra .
and this is a word that appears throughout early mathematics , such as this 10th century deri@@ vation of proof@@ s .
why is it that X is the unknown ?
all right , untie me now and we &apos;ll get some dinner . &quot;
and so there &apos;s no way that this is going to work . &quot;
there are programs you can get to see how people might look if they smoke , if they get too much exposure to the sun , if they gain weight and so on .
the difference in the quality of medical care received by people with mental illness is one of the reasons why they live shorter lives than people without mental illness .
well , in part , because health care in the developed world , the health care costs in the &#91; developed &#93; world , are rapidly spiraling out of control , and a huge chunk of those costs are human resource costs .
well , I think all of you can guess that 12 years on , we &apos;re still nowhere near that goal .
we were losing it at an extraordinary rate -- in fact , of the order of two to four trillion dollars-worth of natural capital .
and here &apos;s what the same calculation looks like , which was done recently -- well I say recently , over the last 10 years -- by a group called T@@ R@@ U@@ CO@@ ST .
well I think we kind of did it at the same time , but he &apos;s done it .
and for some time , he was convinced this was the reason we got along so well .
the implication of that is that the wave function has to go to zero , it has to vanish when the helium atoms touch each other .
Ter@@ u@@ o Kur@@ os@@ aki , who owns a furniture company called I@@ de@@ e , he asked me to ship him two trailers to Tokyo .
and it shows that kids can develop an extended sense of self through a tool at a very young age .
it &apos;s a very simple exercise -- buy a song on I@@ Tunes , write it to a CD , then rip the CD to an MP3 and play it on your very same computer .
and it &apos;s not just aging that causes arthritis .
so if we &apos;re going to transplant animal tissues to people , we have to figure out a way to get rid of that epitope .
so that &apos;s for fun .
so you can see here in the lower level of the library the books and the objects .
onstage at TEDGlobal , P@@ é@@ ter F@@ ank@@ ha@@ user demonstrates Rezero , a robot that balances on a ball . designed and built by a group of engineering students , Rezero is the first ball@@ bot made to move quickly and gracefully -- and even dance .
instead of wheels , a Ball@@ bot is balancing and moving on one single ball .
so this requires figuring out how to get the most out of something &apos;s innate properties and also how to bend it to my will .
to this end , I have worked in sugar for Stefan Sagmeister , three-@@ time TED speaker .
there &apos;s no passing time with you , only collecting -- the collecting of moments with the hope for preservation and at the same time release .
but I really believe that a fully operating , rich society needs these seeds coming from all directions and all disciplines in order to keep the gears of inspiration and imagination flowing and cycling and growing .
Woody Nor@@ ris invents amazing things
so , we &apos;ve been , as I say , very successful , very lucky , in having companies catch the vision of this , from cars -- car makers who want to put a stereo system in the front for the kids , and a separate system in the back -- oh , no , the kids aren &apos;t driving today .
it also works five times better underwater .
when you run very short wavelengths , like a tuning fork the antenna resonates , and there &apos;s more energy coming out of the antenna than there is the back@@ scatter from the ground that we &apos;re trying to analyze , taking too much processing . &quot;
and very rapidly , they became multi-@@ cellular , they could replicate , they could use photosynthesis as a way of getting their energy source .
and so he looked at it , and he said , &quot; Thank you . I &apos;ll look at it periodically . &quot;
when &apos;s the last time you had three hours to yourself at the office ?
I think that sleep and work are very closely related , and it &apos;s not just that you can work while you &apos;re sleeping and you can sleep while you &apos;re working .
some of you may work at places where you can &apos;t get to these certain sites .
but meetings also pro@@ create .
Nokia researcher J@@ an Chi@@ p@@ chase &apos;s investigation into the ways we interact with technology has led him from the villages of Uganda to the insides of our pockets . he &apos;s made some unexpected discoveries along the way .
money is useful for buying food , su@@ sten@@ ance , among all its other uses .
you can subscribe to these .
we &apos;re very good at creating personal narratives , but it &apos;s the shared narratives that make us a culture .
this poor kid , clearly a prop -- don &apos;t get me wrong , a willing prop -- but the kiss that &apos;s being documented kind of looks like it sucks .
and most of what we know about regret comes to us out of that domain .
all right .
thank you .
when film critic Roger Ebert lost his lower jaw to cancer , he lost the ability to eat and speak . but he did not lose his voice . in a moving talk from TED2011 , Ebert and his wife , Chaz , with friends Dean Ornish and John Hunter , come together to tell his remarkable story .
the doctors took a fi@@ bula bone from my leg and some tissue from my shoulder to fashion into a new jaw .
indeed , I am lucky to live in history at all , because without intelligence and memory there is no history .
then we adjust the content accordingly .
why am I asking all of these business questions , instead of just showing them pages ?
so what is the lesson behind it ?
it fo@@ amed , and horrible things were happening to me .
the young man &apos;s name was E@@ vari@@ ste Galois .
I could rotate it by a third of a turn , or a half a turn , or put it back down on its image , or two thirds of a turn .
now , I &apos;m a great believer that mathematics is not a spectator sport , and you have to do some mathematics in order to really understand it .
now , let &apos;s do it in a different order .
so G@@ he@@ z , there we go . that &apos;s your new symmetrical object .
I &apos;ve learned that they &apos;re really the essence of what makes for progress , even when they seem to be terrible .
the skeletal remains from that period have shown that they were grinding grain morning , noon and night .
the physicians of the ancient world -- especially the Egyptians , who started medicine as we know it -- were very conscious of what they could and couldn &apos;t treat .
and nobody knows just why this was so , but one story can reflect something of it .
and I &apos;d like to bring that experience to the desktop .
so one of the things you can do to our icons , just like paper , is crease them and fold them , just like paper . remember , you know , something for later .
and it &apos;s specifically algorithms , which are basically the math that computers use to decide stuff .
and I said , &quot; So what were you doing ? &quot;
and that &apos;s the thing , is that we &apos;re writing things , we &apos;re writing these things that we can no longer read .
this is some mathematicians at MIT .
but now there &apos;s this third co-@@ evolutionary force : algorithms -- the Boston Shuff@@ ler , the Car@@ nival .
because it is saving lives . so , is there a better way to accomplish that goal ?
it &apos;s kind of shaped like a T , as in taking turns .
so now you &apos;re faced with telling your patient , first of all , that they may need another surgery , or that they need additional therapy such as radiation or chemotherapy .
the molecule they had developed had three parts .
so they added two additional components .
but I bet there &apos;s something you didn &apos;t think about today -- something so close to home that you probably don &apos;t think about it very often at all .
they take our identity and change our emotions and change who we are as people .
and one story I want to tell you about is how can we find targets for treating post-traumatic stress disorder -- a form of uncontrolled anxiety and fear .
in its early days -- these have not been done on humans yet -- but we &apos;re working on a variety of studies to try and examine this , and so far we haven &apos;t seen overt reactions of any severity to these molecules or to the illumination of the brain with light .
light is converted to electricity on them .
and all the people who lived in the neighborhood , who owned restaurants and bars in the neighborhood , were all out there -- had them all open .
it &apos;s some guy , it &apos;s a Ge@@ o@@ Cities homepage of some guy that I found online who &apos;s interested , if you look at the bottom , in soccer and Jesus and Gar@@ th Brooks and Cl@@ int Bec@@ k@@ ham and &quot; my hometown &quot; -- those are his links .
you can also rank it by the latest posts .
and it turns out , actually , that 42 percent is the Mola mola fish .
now , there &apos;s one way to interpret this , which is to say that &quot; emancipation &quot; and &quot; depression &quot; and &quot; recovery &quot; all have a lot of syllab@@ les .
we can ask ourselves , what is justice , and is justice blind , or is justice blindness ?
now if I was a bird , the building on my left is a liability .
in 1984 , we did the first so-called &quot; green office &quot; in America for Environmental Defense .
from this , we &apos;re able to then fragment that brain into further pieces , which then we can put on a smaller cry@@ ost@@ at .
we take that tissue , we puri@@ fy the RNA out of it using some basic technology , and then we put a florescent tag on it .
make it easy and give a kilo of lentils , you multiply immunization rate by six .
and people who got the free one were actually more likely to purchase the second one than people who didn &apos;t get a free one .
I gave you three simple answers to three questions : give lentils to immunize people , provide free bed nets , de@@ worm children .
fantastic tales , anecdotes from speakers .
and she said , &quot; I want to write a case , Eu@@ vin -- a case on a public-@@ sector leader that has lessons for the corporate world . &quot;
and this is what today is about -- it &apos;s about discussing those very opportunities .
but what were they there for ? to acquire assets .
if you haven &apos;t , why not ?
but with Africa , let &apos;s start being careful about this .
the same for telecoms across the country .
it &apos;s more expensive to transport goods . prices of goods go up , inflation is affected .
so I showed him this , and this is actual footage that he was on . this is Apollo 15 . this was his mission .
I want you to just stand exactly like this for me , pull up your sleeves , if you don &apos;t mind .
a voodoo experiment .
can you stand up ?
OK , it worked that time , excellent .
OK , think of how many letters in the title of his name .
KB : almost , oh . OK , you &apos;re making sure that &apos;s well hidden . now -- oh , we &apos;ve got one here , we &apos;ve got one here .
don &apos;t stack them up , OK .
your right hand . is that -- no , OK .
KB : OK . do you think it &apos;s here , yes or no ?
you &apos;re going to sit on these hard chairs for an hour and a half .
but why do they do this ?
and instead of sharing money , they become selfish .
and right next to where I used to work , there was a slum .
so I said , &quot; Well that &apos;s impossible , because -- How is it possible ? they don &apos;t know anything . &quot;
well , we know what they &apos;re like today .
it &apos;s a facility which is practically unmanned .
it &apos;s very easy to do . there &apos;s a great document produced by TED which tells you how to do it .
it &apos;s kind of a funny , goofy sound to do .
but it &apos;s meant that acoustici@@ ans have had to really think about the types of halls they put together . there are so few halls in this world that actually have very good acoustics , dare I say . but by that I mean where you can absolutely do anything you imagine .
and this is quite interesting .
in another year &apos;s time , three extra steps .
/ b / is the first board we started with , and it is , in many ways , the beating heart of the website .
when I get emails , people say , &quot; Thank you for giving me this place , this outlet , where I can come after work and be myself . &quot;
you &apos;ve got this surprising semi-@@ underground influence , but it &apos;s not making you a lot of money , yet .
CA : and they were probably pleased to see you on top of the Time poll .
a three-and-a-half foot thing , beautiful skull , predator , me@@ at-@@ eater , a two-legged animal .
we need to del@@ ve into this mass of anatomy that we &apos;ve been compiling to understand where the changes are occurring and what this means .
dinosaurs was one of them .
the next step is to learn the capability to make yourself a scientist .
it &apos;s hard to get them to envision themselves as a scientist , which involves standing up in front of people like we &apos;re doing here at this sym@@ posi@@ um and presenting something as a knowledgeable person , and then seeing yourself in the role as a scientist and giving yourself the tools to pursue that .
I mean , we &apos;ve been doing it for two million years , so it &apos;s kind of arrogant to assume that I &apos;ve got something to say that hasn &apos;t been said and performed better a long time ago .
the key to being part of a hunting pack is the word &quot; pack . &quot;
that &apos;s because an Ap@@ ache tri@@ ath@@ lon used to be you &apos;d run 50 miles across the desert , engage in hand@@ -to-@@ hand combat , steal a bunch of horses and slap leather for home .
scientist : I want to show you something .
but with the robot , you can .
we looked at their desire to cooperate .
now let &apos;s try to put this into a little bit of context .
so one of the things we really wanted to look at was not how much weight people lost , but really how long they interacted with the robot .
and when you look at emotional engagement , it was completely different .
and with some look-@@ ali@@ kes , they are so good you don &apos;t know whether they &apos;re real or not .
it &apos;s an extremely fast way of getting information .
that &apos;s why this image was made one year ago , and what it means today .
so , I &apos;ll leave you with these clips to have a look .
Chris Anderson : thank you .
but start telling them , you know , we &apos;re going to try to do it in Nigeria -- everyone runs away .
I &apos;m happy to say that the things we have implemented -- 80 percent of U.S. practices do not have them , and yet the technology is there .
when we do it , we will put the cost of care down .
that way we &apos;re not going to deal with ob@@ so@@ lesc@@ ence and all those kinds of issues .
so , what is thinking in pictures ? it &apos;s literally movies in your head .
now , the thing is , the visual thinker &apos;s just one kind of mind .
now , this is pattern thinking . that praying mantis is made from a single sheet of paper -- no sc@@ ot@@ ch tape , no cuts .
and there in the background is the pattern for folding it .
you know , it &apos;s going to be variable .
it &apos;s all very detailed information , and , looking at these kind of details gave me a lot of insight into animals .
let &apos;s say the kid is fixated on Legos .
I &apos;m Morgan H@@ end@@ ry . I am NASA .
and somehow , through some dynamic effect , we &apos;re having these geysers which are being , you know , emitted from it .
so in closing , I said I want to close by a couple of pictures .
and I think some of these technologies will enable us to be more connected with our patients , and take more time and actually do the important human touch elements of medicine , as augmented by these sorts of technologies .
and that &apos;s when it gets interesting , when we start to crowdsource that information .
but where is stem cell therapy really going ?
and I think they &apos;ll be a new era of your own stem cell banking to have in the free@@ zer your own cardiac cells , my@@ ocy@@ tes and neural cells to use them in the future , should you need them .
but often it &apos;s too late and it &apos;s Stage III or IV cancer , for example .
dare I admit that after she did it I never really loved her again ?
it &apos;s called &quot; The N@@ eigh@@ bor . &quot;
&quot; behold me , &quot; the god of fr@@ enz@@ ied , inexhaustible love says , rising in bloody splendor , &quot; Be@@ hold me . &quot;
still , to be able to die with no special con@@ tri@@ tion , not having been slaughtered , or enslaved .
news photos brought people face to face with the victims of the war : a little girl burned by napalm , a student killed by the National Guard at K@@ ent State University in Ohio during a protest .
in the 1980s , the stigma@@ tization of people with the disease was an enormous barrier to even discussing or addressing it .
I don &apos;t want to answer these now . I &apos;ll come on to them at the end .
I &apos;m lying in the tent , getting ready to go .
the weather is just appalling -- oh , drifted back about five miles in the last -- last night .
I &apos;d navigate using the direction of the wind .
the door opened . this guy jumped out . he &apos;s about that tall . he said , &quot; Hi , my name is Troy . &quot;
if you include the coastal ice shelves , you can see that the Ross Ice Shelf -- it &apos;s the big one down here -- the Ross Ice Shelf is the size of France .
I said , &quot; What happens when I grow older and my hair becomes white ?
this is coming from a Jewish guy , all right , so that means a lot .
do you enjoy looking non-@@ symmetric ?
and when we run experiments , we usually hope that one group will behave differently than another .
the problem was that they listened to the wrong story .
so what we see is that voters respond very well to things like this and not quite so well to things like this .
and they are heterosex@@ uals who come from countries that have traditions of poly@@ ga@@ my and relatively high levels of female autonomy , and almost all of those countries are in east or southern Africa .
and while this was the major difference between many initiatives before to create change , before we thought , and governments told us -- and even sometimes it was true -- that change was imposed on us , and people rejected that , because they thought that it is alien to their culture .
how did the elite deal with that -- the so-called political elite ?
for 18 days , our cameras were broadcasting , live , the voices of the people in Tahrir Square .
I remember one night when someone phoned me on my cellphone -- ordinary person who I don &apos;t know -- from Tahrir Square .
how would you characterize the historical significance of what &apos;s happened ?
WK : I think we have discovered a very important issue in the Arab world -- that people care , people care about this great transformation .
why , without them , you &apos;d be a total stranger . &quot;
I went up to him and said , how can I learn that ?
call me in the morning after a dose of these steel guitar blues .
no problem . yeah , you know . &quot;
so I decided to close it down for one year .
and here we asked some nearby pigs to do the titles for us .
so we asked those guys to do it again .
so , we think a lot about what really makes science work ?
so that is both Aristotelian cosmology , and in a certain sense , medieval society .
this is also , if you talk to legal scholars , the foundations of new ideas in legal thought .
in the 20th century , we saw the independent development of two big themes in science .
now , if you think about democracy from this perspective , a new pluralistic notion of democracy would be one that recognizes that there are many different interests , many different ag@@ end@@ as , many different individuals , many different points of view .
but the actual sub-@@ adult at 65 percent had no crest at all .
and that &apos;s by actually cutting into their bones .
but cutting into the bones of a dinosaur is hard to do , as you can imagine , because in museums bones are precious .
so that &apos;s what I do .
it &apos;s unclear to me how they actually sorted these three of them out .
and if we look at Pachycephal@@ osaurus , Pachycephal@@ osaurus has a solid dome and its little bumps on the back of its head were also resor@@ bing .
but there &apos;s another dinosaur that is found in this formation that looks like a Triceratops , except it &apos;s bigger , and it &apos;s called Torosaurus .
and she &apos;s desperate to find more evidence for the link .
&quot; I &apos;m sorry . I &apos;ve only got 18 minutes , 18 minutes to talk about saving the world , saving the planet , global institutions .
the thing that all the work has in common is that it challenges the assumptions about conventions of space .
now , here we go , one side , the outside and then from the inside of the space you can see what the quality of the space was .
this is &quot; So@@ ft S@@ ell &quot; for 4@@ 2nd Street .
and we actually had to install white walls to separate these pieces , which didn &apos;t belong together .
the clients have asked us to produce a great chamber music hall .
and this great news gives birth to even more great news , because the historic trend is this .
but there &apos;s a vaccine for that too .
we are going to win because we don &apos;t have a party political agenda .
now for the last 25 years , N@@ ed Se@@ eman and a bunch of his descendants have worked very hard and made beautiful three-dimensional structures using this kind of reaction of DNA strands coming together .
but to do it , you need a long , single strand of DNA , which is technically very difficult to get .
so there &apos;s a strand that goes like this , goes along one helix and binds -- it jumps to another helix and comes back .
and so , I got this in the mail about a year after I did this , unsolicited .
and if you look at their sticky ends , these little DNA bits , you can see that they actually form a check@@ er@@ board pattern .
it knows how big it is .
now I come back to the idea of the new social enterprise that I &apos;m exploring .
or , &quot; Let me see who I can corrupt today . &quot;
but what is the use if the police department is in itself steeped in corruption ?
through his charities I have had three police cases filed against me alle@@ ging trespass , imperson@@ ation and intimi@@ dation .
the battle against corruption exac@@ ts a toll on ourselves , our families , our friends , and even our kids .
and an insane person does not know what an impossible task is . &quot; thank you .
they need to learn to respect their school@@ mates .
not only were they enthusiastic , they kept thinking they &apos;re there to help us .
you think I &apos;ll be able to drive it ? &quot;
&quot; who is entitled to what ?
those are tough questions .
I was talking to one of them , and he was really liking this arm -- it &apos;s way , way , way better than a plastic stick with a hook on it -- but there &apos;s nobody in this room that would rather have that than the one you got .
and I said to that kid , &quot; I &apos;ll stop when your buddies are en@@ vious of your Luke arm because of what it can do , and how it does it .
it was , for me , one of the most difficult things I &apos;d ever done , but it was also the most beautiful .
I &apos;m six foot one , and fat .
and by eating so well and training so hard , my resting heart-@@ rate dropped to 38 beats per minute .
this was a critical mistake .
so , it was a pretty big success .
they had doctors with the &quot; P@@ st , &quot; you know , so , sitting there waiting .
and then suddenly I hear screaming .
narrator : and so he walked , and as he walked he saw things .
blood diamonds , smuggled emer@@ al@@ ds , timber , that is cut right from under the poorest .
I will not deal with those first two , except to say that un@@ critical transfer of assumptions , from one context to another , can only make for disaster .
but people at Oxford prepared for a democratic Germany and engaged in planning .
now , the issue that should concern us here -- and that &apos;s the challenge that I would like to pose to this group -- is again , it takes 16 years in your countries to produce somebody with a B@@ .S. degree .
you only want clean environments in which to function .
it is important , but what the ordinary women and men who engage in micro-@@ production want is global access .
as many as 100 million refugees from Bangladesh could be expected to migrate into India and into China .
now this is the real . it &apos;s a cauliflower .
one day , a friend of mine , to bug me , brought a picture and said , &quot; What is the roughness of this curve ? &quot;
they may be mountains , but they may be just formul@@ ae , just cran@@ ked on .
it used to be very time-consuming , but now it &apos;s nothing .
three of them were having incomplete proof@@ s .
well actually I started , oddly enough , studying stock market prices .
is it thinking lamprey eel thoughts , sitting there in its nutrient medium ?
he knew that darkly pigmented peoples were found close to the equator ; lightly pigmented peoples , like himself , were found closer to the poles .
and he went on to say , &quot; These differences do not coinci@@ de with corresponding differences in climate . &quot;
he had seen people of different colors living in different places .
in the winter , when you are skiing in the Alps , you may experience ultraviolet radiation .
look at some of the major la@@ titu@@ dinal trans@@ gres@@ sions : people from high UV areas going to low UV and vice versa .
you just have to look at your skin .
understand it . appreciate it . celebrate it .
now you &apos;re going to have 30 minutes to solve 15 puzzles .
volatile stock market , getting negative feedback that &apos;s also immediate .
and the feedback in all these cases is concrete .
that casts your decision in doubt , reduces the confidence you have in the decision , reduces the confidence you have in the performance , the performance in terms of solving the puzzles .
the freedom to chose where to live , what to do , what to buy , what to sell , from whom , to whom , when and how .
in fact , in my view , there is no region of the world and no period in history that farmers have been expected to bear the kind of market risk that Africa &apos;s farmers have to bear .
the Chicago Board of Trade was established then for precisely the same reasons that our farmers today would benefit from a commodity exchange .
and in fact , would even dump the grain in Lake Michigan , rather than spend more money transporting it back to their farms .
similarly , there &apos;s been explosive growth in India , for example , where rural farmers are using exchanges -- growing here over the last three years by 2@@ 70 percent a year .
in our approach in Ethiopia , we &apos;ve decided to put together the entire ecosystem , or environment , in which trade takes place .
but I don &apos;t really believe in architectural problems ; I only believe in opportunities .
it is peaceful and violent .
now , part of the formal control over this structure would be lost to nature , obviously , as the bacteria do their work .
and quite frankly , we &apos;re putting our heads in the sand .
but , if I had something like a TED wish , it would be to actually get it built , to start building this habitable wall , this very , very long , but very narrow city in the desert , built into the du@@ ne@@ scape itself .
and within a few months after that sea urchin dying , the seaweed started to grow .
encounter one : ocean City , New Jersey , 1980 .
I had stopped hearing the sound of the ocean .
I went to see the movie &quot; D@@ une , &quot; and a girl talked to me . now , on its face -- -- this is impossible on its face , I realize -- but it is absolutely true .
when I say it out loud , it sounds so ridiculous , but I can only come to the conclusion that it was what , in the alien abduc@@ tee community , they call a &quot; screen memory &quot; : a ridiculous false recollection designed by their brain to cover up some trauma -- say , of being kidnapped and flown off to a sex pyramid .
one of them was named Joseph , and he asked me what was I doing , and I explained .
what is the objective ?
I am helpless over this . &quot;
but actually , I mean , this feeling of helplessness comes in because most Americans actually feel that oil prices are the result of a conspiracy , not of the vic@@ is@@ situ@@ des of the world oil market .
we talk about biofuels that haven &apos;t been invented yet .
so , what I &apos;m going to talk to you about now is : what do we have to do this time ?
and in the last season there were two women in the fin@@ alists .
the water is completely black .
take some time to rest and think about things .
now , TED sends you a lot of spam if you &apos;re a speaker about &quot; do this , do that &quot; and you fill out all these forms , and you don &apos;t actually know how they &apos;re going to describe you , and it fla@@ shed across my desk that they were going to introduce me as a futurist .
and that has feature sizes down to about 20 nanometers , and it &apos;s a complex 3D structure .
you set a couple of boundary conditions , like gravity , the surface tension , density , etc . , and then you press &quot; execute , &quot; and magically , the universe produces you a perfect ball lens .
however , it &apos;s hard sometimes to remember the extent of that urbanization .
do they , perhaps , include green infrastructure , so that we can take runoff and water that &apos;s going out of our houses and clean it and filter it and grow urban street trees ?
do they connect us back to the ecosystems around us by , for example , connecting us to rivers and allowing for restoration ?
and there are a number of possibilities , such as increasing circles of reciprocity in the sense that Robert Wright argues for .
but war isn &apos;t the only reason that life is difficult in the DRC .
I &apos;m going to talk about your mindset .
and we had one set of countries up there which was the western world .
and United States only had some , one , two thousand dollars at that time .
that &apos;s where we were , 1900 .
and they made the social investment . they got away malaria .
and in fact , that &apos;s actually sustaining a long-standing trend that pre@@ dates human beings , OK , that biological evolution was doing for us .
so let &apos;s call it the death spiral of nega@@ tivity .
I also like it because it &apos;s an intrinsically kind of morally re@@ deem@@ ing exercise .
and I &apos;m going to suggest to you that &apos;s not nearly enough , in just a moment .
in a couple of minutes , I &apos;ll tell you about some of those results .
and I believe there are three different -- and I call them different because different interventions build them , it &apos;s possible to have one rather than the other -- three different happy lives .
the question is , is Len unhappy ? and I want to say not .
well , my undergraduates and the people I work with haven &apos;t discovered this , so we actually have people do something altruistic and do something fun , and to contrast it .
how do we begin to do that , and why is aid the bad instrument ?
because they don &apos;t need to talk to their own citizens .
I can see his hands reaching out , and I can see his face in terror , looking at me , saying , &quot; Help me , Dad . &quot;
this is actually one of the rangers .
eventually , though , Paul thinks that she just figured that he was never going to survive .
and lost interest with him , and went back to what she does best .
but I didn &apos;t like the way -- the instruction I got was very poor .
and fortunately , I saved his life .
and what of important things -- I think all of you here have a cell phone .
he had the same iri@@ dium cell phone like me .
there are more stages involved here than I &apos;ve got time to tell you about , but basically we drive through the space , we pop@@ ulate it with environmental variables -- sul@@ p@@ hide , h@@ ali@@ de , things like that .
there &apos;s a myth that you can &apos;t do anything in space for less than a trillion dollars and 20 years .
we &apos;re living in one of the most exciting times in history .
we can do it by jump-@@ starting with an industrial Lewis and Clark expedition to Shackleton crater , to mine the moon for resources , and demonstrate they can form the basis for a profitable business on orbit .
you become very creative , in a survival sense .
a very famous Chinese saying , she said .
not all of us can go to Africa , or work at hospitals , so what do we do , if we have this moral response , this feeling ?
and my mother decided that that information must have come from my grandmother .
or is it a kind of serendipity that we cannot explain , like the cosmological constant ?
and that &apos;s how I &apos;ve discovered that if I feel what is in the story -- in one story -- then I come the closest , I think , to knowing what compassion is , to feeling that compassion .
and this picture frame has a cord going out the back , and you plug it into the wall .
now , at countless meetings at , you know , the Portland City Council , or who knows where , they said , we need an architect -- can we get Frank Gehry ?
and my big failure ? I came out with an entire record album and hopefully a whole bunch of record albums in SA@@ CD format -- this remarkable new format -- and I marketed it straight to people with 20@@ ,000-dollar stereos .
the first story that I did for National Geographic , where I recognized the ability to include environmental issues within a natural history coverage , was a story I proposed on harp seals .
but as I got more involved in the story , I realized that there were two big environmental issues I couldn &apos;t ignore .
as I wandered around and made these pictures , it sort of occurred to me that the ocean &apos;s not a grocery store , you know .
but , you know , thousands of other leatherbacks each year are not so fortunate , and the species &apos; future is in great danger .
this photograph shows my assistant standing on the bottom at about 70 feet and one of these amazingly beautiful , 45-@@ foot , 7@@ 0-@@ ton whales , like a city bus just swimming up , you know .
here &apos;s why .
if we have a positive view about the future then we may be able to accelerate through that turn , instead of care@@ ening off a cliff .
we had slash and burn agriculture ; people cannot afford the fertilizer , so they burn the trees and have the minerals available there ; the fires become more frequent , and after a while you &apos;re stuck with an area of land where there is no fertility left .
there are no trees left .
only then we set up the infrastructure and management and the monetary .
April .
what I really did was I just followed nature , and nature doesn &apos;t know mono@@ cultures , but a natural forest is multi@@ layered .
and this is after two years .
and finally I made it into the rain machine because this forest is now creating its own rain .
and for handic@@ apped , they can use this as a normal system .
we have to move to a model that is based more on principles of agriculture .
they realized that using force against force doesn &apos;t work .
but she told the students to sit down .
and no one got killed .
now that to me is wisdom in action .
and the solution I offer is to the biggest culprit in this massive mistre@@ at@@ ment of the earth by humankind , and the resulting decline of the biosphere .
sa@@ ddled in the performing arts as we are , by antiqu@@ ated union agreements that inhibit and often prohibit mechanical reproduction and streaming , locked into large facilities that were designed to ossi@@ fy the ideal relationship between artist and audience most appropriate to the 19th century and locked into a business model dependent on high ticket revenues , where we charge ex@@ orbit@@ ant prices .
today &apos;s dance world is not defined solely by the Royal Win@@ ni@@ peg Ballet or the National Ballet of Canada , but by Liz L@@ er@@ man &apos;s Dance Exchange -- a multi-@@ generational , professional dance company , whose dancers range in age from 18 to 82 , and who work with genomic scientists to embody the DNA strand and with nuclear physicists at CERN .
God knows , if we ever needed that capacity in human history , we need it now .
the whole story really starts with me as a high school kid in Pittsburgh , Pennsylvania , in a tough neighborhood that everybody gave up on for dead .
and Mr. Ross said , &quot; You &apos;re too smart to die and I don &apos;t want it on my conscience , so I &apos;m leaving this school and I &apos;m taking you with me . &quot;
we &apos;ve heard about your work with the kids and the ex-steel workers , and we &apos;re inclined to want to support your desire to build a new building .
and Senator Heinz sat very quietly and he said , &quot; Well , what would your reaction be if I said I &apos;d give you a million dollars ? &quot;
and we &apos;ve never looked back .
I have 400 kids from the Pittsburgh public school system that come to me every day of the week for arts education .
I can &apos;t get these parents to come to the school . &quot;
and now that I have , I want to give you a gift . &quot;
and the code is in the form of these patterns of electrical pulses that get sent up to the brain , and so the key thing is that the image ultimately gets converted into a code . and when I say code , I do literally mean code .
bacteria are the oldest living organisms on the earth .
we just took the picture by turning the lights off in the room , and this is what we see .
the question that we had is how can bacteria , these primitive organisms , tell the difference from times when they &apos;re alone , and times when they &apos;re in a community , and then all do something together .
on bright nights when there is lots of starlight or moonlight that light can penetrate the depth of the water the squid lives in , since it &apos;s just in those couple feet of water .
we think bacteria made the rules for how multicellular organization works .
I want to thank you for inviting me here .
Michael Sandel : at random . you would do it by lottery .
Ms : all right .
and how many say , no , he doesn &apos;t ?
Ms : what &apos;s your name ?
that &apos;s part of the game of golf ?
but since it is the very nature of a game to have no object except amusement , that is , what distinguishes games from productive activity , it is quite impossible to say that any of a game &apos;s arbitrary rules is essential . &quot;
let me put the point as delic@@ ately as possible : Gol@@ fers are a little sensitive about the athletic status of their game .
and I think we can do that in public life more generally .
that &apos;s what I would love to do .
we do need to really start trying .
first , of course , the economic meltdown .
last , but not least , we believe in profit with principles .
the picture I showed you before , and this picture , of drought , death and disease is what we usually see .
because we are confronted with a challenge .
my sister fell very ill with malaria .
I got there and I saw huge crowds .
by the time we jumped into that hall , she was barely moving .
and as an economist , we can also look at that side of the story .
he said , &quot; There are two things you need only .
infrastructure , infrastructure , infrastructure and discipline .
there are people creating jobs .
she will create another 100 , 200 more jobs .
maybe we &apos;re not the right people to do it .
so what you want to do -- at least with mov@@ em@@ ent-@@ based actions , we do that all the time , so you can visualize it .
in this example , facial expressions are mapped to the movement commands .
now smile to go straight .
Nathan Myhrvold : could this laser zap malaria ?
so I &apos;m going to briefly discuss a couple of problems that we have and a couple of problems where we &apos;ve got some solutions underway .
and we thought , well , that &apos;s not really good enough .
we could spend hours going over this .
it &apos;s an incredibly complicated disease , but that &apos;s actually one of the things we find interesting about it and why we work on malaria : there &apos;s a lot of potential ways in .
so this creates pulses of light that last a fem@@ tos@@ econd .
well , let &apos;s try to kill it with consumer electronics . &quot;
you really want to protect them .
now , after thinking about this a little bit we thought , you know , it probably would be simpler to do this with a non@@ lethal laser .
and P@@ ab@@ los , if he stirs up our mosquitoes a little bit we can see them flying around .
I was experimenting with these -- I don &apos;t know if you can see it -- but there &apos;s a work surface there .
you can &apos;t get rid of waste .
in here , I have produce and boxes that are un@@ avoid@@ able .
this restaurant looks a little bit like A@@ corn House -- same chairs , same tables .
but this is an electrical restaurant .
this is basically air-@@ handling .
so the first of those projects ended up being something I called &quot; One Second Every Day . &quot;
when I turn 40 , I &apos;ll have a one-hour video that includes just my 30s .
now , one of the things that I have issues with is that , as the days and weeks and months go by , time just seems to start blur@@ ring and blending into each other and , you know , I hated that , and visualization is the way to trigger memory .
and these are made of this kind of tube -- electricity tube , we call it in Holland .
and they can use that energy in case the wind falls away , and the tide is coming up , and there is still a little bit of energy to reach the dunes and save their lives , because they are drowned very easily .
one of the biggest enemies are the storms .
there &apos;s parts of the genome where it cannot tolerate even a single error , and then there &apos;s parts of the genome where we can put in large blocks of DNA , as we did with the watermarks , and it can tolerate all kinds of errors .
but every time I thought I was beginning to get a handle on the Koran -- that feeling of &quot; I get it now &quot; -- it would slip away overnight , and I &apos;d come back in the morning wondering if I wasn &apos;t lost in a strange land , and yet the terrain was very familiar .
only God knows the true meaning .
and in particular , how the simple parts of organizations interact to create the behavior of the whole organization .
then the nest maintenance workers work inside the nest , and I wanted to say that the nests look a lot like Bill Li@@ shman &apos;s house .
there are nest maintenance workers working throughout the nest .
but if instead I start to meet a higher number of nest maintenance workers , I &apos;m less likely to forage .
MIT professor Neil Gershenfeld talks about his Fab Lab -- a low-cost lab that lets people build things they need using digital and analog tools . it &apos;s a simple idea with powerful results .
if you need more resource , you just apply more computer .
all the intelligence is external to the system ; the materials don &apos;t have information .
this isn &apos;t technology for communication ; it &apos;s technology to prevent it .
and let me take you back 100 years to 1912 .
does that make sense ?
TBP : fracking ? what is fracking ?
I got out of school in &apos; 51 .
CA : so how does the world get off fossil fuels ?
first of all , this got installed upside down . this light socket -- and so the cord keeps falling out , so I taped it in .
I &apos;m going to argue tonight that compassion and the golden rule are , in a certain sense , built into human nature .
and there , the basic idea is that compassion leads you to do good things for people who then will return the favor .
so , what do those terms mean ?
if they get less and less happy , that will be bad for Americans .
and I think it &apos;s good moral exercise .
had they consumed colored drinks ?
so what does that kind of constructive conflict require ?
and his colleagues don &apos;t think of him as a crank .
well , this is what deep time does to a building .
we looked at mes@@ as in New Mexico .
this place is remote . it &apos;s over 200 miles from any major city .
that &apos;s a 2,000-@@ foot thick formation , and it might be a beautiful place to hide a clock .
and Alexander Rose on the left there worked with a bunch of people from the National Park to survey the whole mine . it &apos;s a mile deep .
then he starts going up , and the next thing I hear is , &quot; I &apos;m half-@@ way up . it &apos;s like climbing stairs . I &apos;m going up 60 degrees .
this is Roc@@ ky Mountain juni@@ pers that have been there for thousands of years .
or if there was a hole I &apos;d think like , oh damn , there was actually someone thought of that thought already .
the color of movies and the way light makes the colors , light from behind the projection , or light from the projection , makes the colors look so impossible .
I want to show you -- I &apos;m also like a big -- I go to astro@@ log@@ ers and tar@@ ot card readers often , and that &apos;s another thing that motivates me a lot .
it &apos;s sort of an excerpt from a quote of hers .
and this has to do with being happy , I swear .
IM : look how cute she looks with this , just a slick back .
if you look at the rise of far-right fascism across Europe of late , you will see some things that are happening that are influencing domestic politics , yet the phenomenon is transnational .
there is no equivalent of the Al-Qaeda , without the terrorism , for democracy across Muslim-majority societies .
neo@@ conserva@@ tism had the philosophy that you go in with a sup@@ ply-@@ led approach to impose democratic values from the top down .
and I want to illustrate that by telling a couple of stories about that transformation .
these tools don &apos;t get socially interesting until they get technologically boring .
but like the Mag@@ in@@ ot Line , the great fire@@ wall of China was facing in the wrong direction for this challenge , because not one of those four things was true in this environment .
and so now the Chinese government , who for a dozen years , has quite successfully filtered the web , is now in the position of having to decide whether to allow or shut down entire services , because the transformation to amateur media is so enormous that they can &apos;t deal with it any other way .
it was Senator Obama when they created it . they changed the name later .
this was my medical kit .
so the climbers passed him by , and Beck lay there for a day , a night and another day , in the snow .
after laying in the snow that long a time , he got up and found his way back to the camp .
the third set of ideas are what I call as &quot; ideas that we argue about &quot; -- those are ideas where we have a fight , an ideological battle about how to do things .
then there is the whole northern India , which is going to be the bulk of the future demographic dividend .
the third big thing I believe that has changed India is our attitude towards the English language .
it &apos;s important because you need it to solve the world &apos;s environment problems .
when the economic growth goes to eight percent and population growth drops to 1.5 percent , then per capita income is doubling every nine years .
five great revolutions have shaped political culture over the past 50 years , says theorist Ivan Kra@@ ste@@ v . he shows how each step forward -- from the cultural revolution of the &apos; 60s to recent revelations in the field of neuroscience -- has also helped ero@@ de trust in the tools of democracy . as he says , &quot; What went right is also what went wrong . &quot; can democracy survive ?
you know who to arrest , who to negotiate with .
it was the human rights moment .
we start to like divor@@ cing , if we &apos;re married at all .
you have Facebook revolutions , Twitter revolutions .
and you know , you walk , and you hear the pieces of skin .
medics who were terrified and couldn &apos;t perform .
and I saw in my IM window that Mike Moriarty was at the base .
there &apos;s such a disconnect .
and they wait until pretty much everybody &apos;s gone .
I &apos;m afraid she &apos;s going to think I &apos;m a monster . &quot;
do you give money to any of the charities ? &quot;
these are people who worked this project for two to three years .
wait till you see , maybe next year , what kind of windows we &apos;ve invented .
so you can change the intensity , the frequency , the duration , the pulse shape of the ultrasound to create anything from an air@@ brush to a hammer .
this is his handwriting on the morning of the treatment before going into the MR So now I &apos;ll take you through &#91; what &#93; a typical procedure like that looks like , &#91; what &#93; noninvasive surgery looks like .
you see the transducer , the light blue .
and it &apos;s not just because of regulation ; it &apos;s because of the amount of money needed under the current evidence-based medicine and the size of trials and so on to make it happen .
there is a unique opportunity now with focused ultrasound guided by MR , because we can actually think about prostate lum@@ p@@ ectomy -- treating just the focal lesion and not removing the whole gland , and by that , avoiding all the issues with potency and in@@ contin@@ ence .
she said , &quot; I &apos;ll buy it , but I &apos;m also going to replicate it . &quot;
this is Vi@@ vi@@ enne West@@ wood . no !
we invited Tom Ford to come -- the conference was called , &quot; Re@@ ady to Share : fashion and the O@@ w@@ nership of Crea@@ tivity &quot; -- and we asked him exactly this question .
so , that does not stop the knock-@@ off artists .
if you look at the regi@@ stry , actually , a lot of the registered things in the E.@@ U .
and these things , because we can copy and transmit them so easily , actually circulate within our culture a lot more like ideas than like physically inst@@ anti@@ ated objects .
I &apos;m with one . he &apos;s my boyfriend , he &apos;s okay .
but that being said , we just as easily could have lost one of the oldest living things on the planet , and the full impact of that disaster is still yet to be seen .
so as you can see , it &apos;s in a chur@@ ch@@ yard ; it &apos;s in Scotland . it &apos;s behind a protective wall .
and the Ba@@ ob@@ abs in particular are a great example of this .
and it &apos;s one -- again , that interconnected root system , making it one genetically identical individual .
we can take the easier road , the more cynical road , which is a road based on sometimes dreams of a past that never really was , a fear of each other , dist@@ ancing and blame .
or we can take the much more difficult path of transformation , transcendence , compassion and love , but also accountability and justice .
so we can also eliminate the ugly ones or the caric@@ atures .
they are made in the right order .
Michael Mer@@ z@@ en@@ ich on re-@@ wiring the brain
this machine , which we all have residing in our skulls , reminds me of an aphor@@ ism , of a comment of Woody Allen to ask about what is the very best thing to have within your skull .
we look in cortical areas that control specific movements , and the sequences of movements that are required in the behavior , and so forth .
it &apos;s not Japanese .
because reading is dependent upon the translation of word sounds into this orth@@ ographic or visual represen@@ tational form .
you know , without them even calling , they &apos;ll get a lot of women volunteers .
you need first funds .
that is my idea .
I make a rural woman to compete with multinationals .
Ma@@ hal@@ ak@@ shmi is chasing me , I am keeping in the back pocket .
Lewis Pugh swims the North Pole
and so ever since I think I was just six years old , I dreamed of going to the polar regions .
so I decided to do this symbolic swim at the top of the world , in a place which should be frozen over , but which now is rapidly un@@ freezing .
it couldn &apos;t be further from the truth for me .
I swam as hard as I could for five minutes .
keeping a baby warm for a week , that &apos;s not rocket science .
let &apos;s figure out what people want .
we decided that I can &apos;t put a &quot; do not enter &quot; sign next to the vent .
one was an interview I did with one of the great American bio@@ graphers .
and he basically was saying that this was a man who lied more than he wished he had , because he saw the letters .
now , these suppliers were our big companies .
this is , under German law , allowed , and the members of our parliament don &apos;t want to change this , and this is why they can &apos;t sign the U.N. convention against foreign bribery -- one of they very , very few countries which is preaching honesty and good governance everywhere in the world , but not able to rati@@ fy the convention , which we managed to get on the books with about 160 countries all over the world .
RA : so now you &apos;re about to see how we do our own movies here , with or without any assistance from anybody .
CA : so on the streets , are film casts ... ?
three weeks later , I received a complete set of drawings saying we &apos;d won the competition .
couldn &apos;t find it .
so , I decided to cut off the head and the tail .
the highlight of the performance was at the end .
the only thing I did was , I made it possible for them to turn those blades so you could sail this thing in the canal , because I love sailing .
and Jay asked me what I was going to do with the piece in the middle .
you &apos;ve got the idea .
it &apos;s made of metal and the brown stuff is F@@ in-@@ P@@ ly -- it &apos;s that formed lumber from Finland .
I feel much more comfortable down here .
apartments , etc .
we studied the acoustics with laser stuff , and they bounce them off this and see where it all works .
time goes on .
so you start with the b@@ agas@@ se , and then you take a very simple kil@@ n that you can make out of a waste fifty five-@@ gallon oil drum .
however , you can &apos;t burn this . it &apos;s too fine and it burns too quickly to be useful for cooking .
and we did side-by-side tests , and here you can see the charcoal briquettes and here the cow dung .
so not only do you have health benefits , you have environmental benefits .
and now I don &apos;t actually mean the world that we live in .
these are the issues that we need to come up with solutions for .
we shouldn &apos;t be doing it from outside .
we have 30 students a year go out into the field and try to implement this and move it forward .
in other words , he looks entirely normal .
and that obviously al@@ er@@ ts the child to their unusual nature .
Hen@@ ri@@ api illustrates this phenomenon as well .
this is a man in his 20s whose first visit out of Nigeria was with this malignant cancer that he came to the United Kingdom to have operated on .
we removed all the bones at the right side of his face -- his eye , his nose , the skull bones , the facial skin -- and reconstructed him with tissue from the back .
so we &apos;ve seen that we can change people &apos;s faces .
they &apos;re people who have their face shot off .
and that has to change , you know .
and the one over there , that &apos;s bigger than my head , is what McDonald &apos;s and Burger King and those big companies think we should eat .
but whoever decided that a chicken should look like a heart , a giraffe , a star ?
so we &apos;re spending less than 5 dollars an hour on the educational system .
you know , if you have kids coming into lunch and all they &apos;re going to do when they get out of lunch is go to have recess , you see them just throw away their lunch so they can run outside .
behind the destruction , I found a soul of places .
so when you hear what I &apos;m going to talk about here today , first of all , I want to say that I am here on behalf of all the patients that I have ever met , all the ones I haven &apos;t met .
they have been saying that since the 1970s .
he said , &quot; Yeah , we &apos;re going to need to do a CT scan of your chest . &quot;
so at that point we knew that it was cancer .
I went home , and I know you can &apos;t read the details here ; that &apos;s not important .
and what I found was on other websites , even by the third page of Google results , &quot; Out@@ look is bleak , &quot; &quot; Pro@@ gn@@ osis is grim . &quot;
and the story of how all that happens is in this book .
amazing thing , those two yellow lines are where I got the two doses of inter@@ le@@ u@@ kin two months apart .
what I &apos;m going to offer you is a recipe , a combination of the two forces that changed the world for good , which is the alliance of compassion and enlightened self-interest .
in fact , if you &apos;ve got good enough governance , there is no resource boom .
and the question is whether the short run will persist .
surgeons are not made either .
it &apos;s not a lecture , it &apos;s not a course , it &apos;s all of that plus a high-@@ stakes assessment .
this story is about taking imagination seriously .
so , to me , using photography -- and I feel that all of us need to now begin to really take the task of using our talents , our ways of thinking , to begin to deal with what I think is probably one of the most challenging issues of our time , how to deal with our energy crisis .
but this is just the point .
whenever we are talking about facts certain opinions must be excluded .
and to do that , we have to admit that these questions have answers .
Chris Anderson : so , some combu@@ stible material there .
language seems to be really important here .
I &apos;m a bug lover , myself -- not from childhood , by the way , but rather late .
here , in front of this building , I &apos;m sure .
and if this is a female , she &apos;ll immediately mate with a male and off she goes because time is very short .
here you can see the adult , black , and two young ones .
and this gap really narrows .
step by step , it does narrow .
this is the &apos; 58 Bul@@ ge@@ mobile : so new , they make tomorrow look like yesterday .
the flying car which never got off the ground -- it was a post-war dream .
and authenticity is a major part of my serious nonsense .
it has no meaning , just -- Des@@ oto discovers the Mississippi , and it &apos;s a Des@@ oto discovering the Mississippi .
I did that as a quick back page -- I had like four hours to do a back page for an issue of the Lam@@ poon , and I did that , and I thought , &quot; Well , I &apos;m ashamed . I hope nobody knows it . &quot;
obviously the answer to this question is not going to be a single factor . if anyone tells you that there is a single-@@ factor explanation for societal collapses , you know right away that they &apos;re an idiot . this is a complex subject .
and then finally , the fifth item on my checklist is the political , economic , social and cultural factors in the society that make it more or less likely that the society will perceive and solve its environmental problems . in the case of the Greenland Norse , cultural factors that made it difficult for them to solve their problems were : their commitments to a Christian society investing heavily in cathedrals ; their being a competi@@ tive-@@ ranked chiefly society ; and their sc@@ orn for the Inuit , from whom they refused to learn . so that &apos;s how the five-@@ part framework is relevant to the collapse and eventual extinction of the Greenland Norse .
but the small animals that eat insects are being eaten by larger animals , still larger animals .
and we eat quite a lot of it .
you take 10 kilograms of feed , you can get one kilogram of beef , but you can get nine kilograms of locust meat .
in fact , a locust is a &quot; shrimp &quot; of the land , and it would make very good into our diet .
you should try it yourself .
and it was a device that , in fact , is a model of the sky .
there is the position of the sun , moon and planets on the movable rete .
so , it &apos;s about 26 degrees . you can &apos;t see it from over there .
and I find this one really extraordinary because the rete pattern is completely symmetrical , and it accurately maps a completely asymmetrical , or random sky .
Hey , are you from Canada ? &quot; Oh , me too ! Hi ! &quot;
well , they signed me up immediately .
so , I &apos;ve been talking to a lot of NASA JPL scientists -- at JPL they are famous for the Mars rovers -- and the scientists , geologists always tell me that the real interesting science , the science-@@ rich sites , are always at the cliffs .
so , when the visitors come , M@@ ARS walks up to the computer , starts typing &quot; Hello , my name is M@@ ARS . &quot;
welcome to Ro@@ Me@@ La , the Robotics M@@ echan@@ isms Laboratory at Virginia Tech .
Dennis Hong : so , there is actually a competition called Robo@@ Cup .
these are just the awards that we won in 2007 fall from robotics competitions and those kinds of things .
so , I need to decipher what I wrote .
now , the main defense against pack@@ -@@ hunting predators is to get into herds , and the larger the herd , the safer the individuals .
now , large herds dung and ur@@ inate all over their own food , and they have to keep moving , and it was that movement that prevented the over@@ grazing of plants , while the periodic tram@@ pling ensured good cover of the soil , as we see where a herd has passed .
it has just come through four months of rain , and it &apos;s now going into eight months of dry season .
let &apos;s look at some results .
this is land close to land that we manage in Zimbabwe .
when you first start this and you bring in a flock of animals , it &apos;s desert . what do they eat ? how does that part work ?
CA : that is an astonishing talk , truly an astonishing talk , and I think you heard that we all are cheering you on your way .
we &apos;ve seen this story all over the country and even in places beyond the American borders .
the economy is mostly agricultural .
and I should say that these are three things that we &apos;ve done in Bertie County , but I feel pretty confident that they could work in a lot of other rural communities around the U.S. and maybe even beyond .
the whites that you see in the middle of his pupils are con@@ genital cataracts , so op@@ acities of the lens .
in our eyes , the lens is clear , but in this child , the lens has become opaque , and therefore he can &apos;t see the world .
it &apos;s a profound question , and what &apos;s even more amazing is how simple the answer is .
so , while the child is playing Pong , we are tracking where they &apos;re looking .
in this TED archive video from 1998 , par@@ alym@@ p@@ ic sprinter Aimee Mullins talks about her record-@@ setting career as a runner , and about the amazing carbon-fiber prosthetic legs that helped her cross the finish line .
and I went out there and made it to the Big East , which was sort of the championship race at the end of the season .
and at about 85 meters of my 100 meters sprint , in all my glory , I came out of my leg .
and he just sat there like this .
all this training -- I had transformed my life .
I &apos;m like , &quot; Get it off ! don &apos;t worry about it , you know .
now this is a key number from the copyright mathematicians &apos; toolkit .
so if you go through lots of examples , you can get the answer , you can understand how the basics of the system work better .
so that &apos;s a different way to look at stuff .
in the real world , we have people who collaborate ; we have people who have to work together , and we have many different displays .
and this is a movement where -- this is started by a psychologist in Virginia , who says that you should never , ever lie , except maybe during poker and golf , his only exceptions .
the first was avoiding the little sins that we all commit every day .
it happened -- I was in the park , and I was dressed in my biblical clothing , so sandals and sort of a white robe , you know , because again , the outer affects the inner .
and it &apos;s sort of evolved .
you blow out candles on top of a birthday cake .
the media landscape in the 20th century was very good at helping people consume , and we got , as a result , very good at consuming .
by adding a fine , what they did was communicate to the parents that their entire debt to the teachers had been discharged with the payment of 10 she@@ k@@ els , and that there was no residue of guilt or social concern that the parents owed the teachers .
Ushahidi , by contrast , is civic value .
Har@@ sha B@@ ho@@ gle : the rise of cricket , the rise of India
and that &apos;s what I &apos;m going to talk about , how a small change leads to a very big revolution .
another half an hour and we would have won . &quot;
and suddenly we fell in love with the 50-@@ over game , and we played it virtually every day .
so , it &apos;s a bit of a curve , that .
there was criticism too because they said , &quot; P@@ layers are being bought and sold ?
right so , finally , an English game that India us@@ ur@@ ped a little bit , but T20 is going to be the next missionary in the world .
it &apos;s very easy for all of us to bring to mind instances of news stories or news@@ re@@ els where we &apos;ve seen tornadoes devastating cities , or some poor sch@@ muck who &apos;s blown his hands off with a fire@@ work on the Four@@ th of July .
there &apos;s 10 tickets in this lottery .
for example , this is , of course , one of the most delicious tricks in marketing , is to say something used to be higher , and suddenly it seems like a very good deal .
this tendency to compare to the past is causing people to pass up the better deal . in other words , a good deal that used to be a great deal is not nearly as good as an awful deal that was once a horrible deal .
most people say they would .
that &apos;s why they don &apos;t know whether their mutual fund manager is taking 0.1 percent or 0.@@ 15 percent of their investment , but they clip coupons to save one dollar off of toothpaste .
if we &apos;re not here in 10,000 years , it &apos;s going to be because we could not take advantage of the gift given to us by a young Dutch fellow in 17@@ 38 , because we underestimated the odds of our future pains and over@@ estimated the value of our present pleasures .
and as the Israeli mother said , she said , &quot; We never let them win by stopping weddings . &quot;
I don &apos;t want to say -- please , I &apos;m going to get quoted somewhere as saying , &quot; Ter@@ r@@ or@@ ism is fine and we shouldn &apos;t be so distressed . &quot;
I know , because I &apos;ve interviewed about 1,000 lottery buyers over the years .
I would disagree that people know they &apos;re not going to win .
we can do the same for geothermal energy and solar power .
it says , &quot; Thou@@ ghts : this poem is impossible .
the shadow of Magritte falls across the central part of the poster a poetic event that occurs as the shadow man isol@@ ates the word &apos; hat , &apos; hidden in the word &apos; whatever . &apos; the four hats shown in the poster suggests how art might be defined : as a thing itself , the worth of the thing , the shadow of the thing , and the shape of the thing .
you &apos;re just too blind to see it now .
Marcus : whose reality ?
God will forgive us .
our government was corrupt .
and it didn &apos;t seem , at least , that your sell outs , whatever they were , were very big .
they came for three days .
in one case , I flew all the way to Mal@@ aga with a team because the thing was signed with seals and various very official seals from the city , and that they wanted me to come and do a building in their port .
I &apos;m going to make it for you !
when we get negative feedback , we still , the next time we &apos;re face with a certain context , tend to make the same errors .
accepting his 2005 TED Prize , photographer Edward Bur@@ tynsky makes a wish : that his images -- stunning landscapes that document humanity &apos;s impact on the world -- help persuade millions to join a global conversation on sustainability .
so I really had a chance to experience that .
and we all look forward to those things .
and this is like 10 weeks later , demolished by hand .
this is a need for power , and they &apos;re willing to go through this massive transformation , on this scale , to get that power .
this is a textile where they &apos;re doing shirts -- Youn@@ g@@ or , the biggest shirt factory and clothing factory in China .
and to me the whole notion -- the things I &apos;m photographing are out of a great concern about the scale of our progress and what we call progress .
and so for me , one of the things that I thought would be to put some of my work in the service of promoting the Worldchanging.com website .
when Dr. Martin Luther King , J@@ r. was assassinated , that day , everybody in my community was upset .
one more picture while I &apos;m stinking and thinking about the Riverside Church : 9 / 11 . last night at Cha@@ grin Fall , a newsp@@ aper@@ man and a television guy said , &quot; That evening , when a service was held at the Riverside Church , we carried it on our station in this city .
many people think of it primarily in terms of charity , random acts of kindness .
the world that meant a lot to me , I saw it vanish in my face .
and not only that , when I was eight I became a child soldier .
run , duck , play dead and hide .
ah ! the children of Darfur .
I know it &apos;s a shame . but who is to be blamed ?
one of them happened to be me now .
so , I said , &quot; Yeah , yeah , age of reason . what does that mean again ? &quot;
like , if you &apos;d lost a leg , well , you get it back .
if someone came to my door and I was hearing Catholic theology and dogma for the very first time , and they said , &quot; We believe that God impregnated a very young girl without the use of intercourse , and the fact that she was a virgin is mani@@ ac@@ ally important to us -- -- and she had a baby , and that &apos;s the son of God , &quot; I mean , I would think that &apos;s equally ridiculous .
but since they asked me that question with the word believe in it , somehow it was all different , because I wasn &apos;t exactly sure if I believed what I so clearly felt .
they have one of the highest literacy rates in Latin America and in the world .
another way of looking at it is looking at time trends .
the second one is be active .
he said , &quot; I know there are challenges ahead , there may be trouble ahead , but I fear no one . I don &apos;t care .
I danced between chemo and radiation cycles and bad@@ gered him to fit it to my performing dance schedule .
it had underground all the data OK , data is brown and bo@@ xy and boring , and that &apos;s how we think of it , isn &apos;t it ?
in fact , data is about our lives .
OK , so it &apos;s called linked data .
I want you to make it .
there &apos;s a new field in brain science , social neuroscience .
that is to say , if we attend to the other person , we automatically empathize , we automatically feel with them .
I was doing my taxes the other day , and I got to the point where I was listing all of the donations I gave , and I had an epiphany , it was -- I came to my check to the Seva Foundation and I noticed that I thought , boy , my friend Larry Brilliant would really be happy that I gave money to Seva .
and the question is : will it make a difference ?
what does the brand stand for in your head ?
CA : so , just help us with some of the numbers .
well , I got pulled out of the sea I think six times by helicopters , so -- and each time , I didn &apos;t expect to come home to tell the tale .
didn &apos;t -- weren &apos;t you just terrible at school ?
yes , I &apos;ll , you know , be in touch . we &apos;re very lucky , we have this tiny little island in the Caribbean and we can -- so I can take them there and we can bring friends , and we can play together , but I can also keep in touch with what &apos;s going on .
it &apos;s got to be consistent .
I would say with a great smile , &quot; I will definitely pass . &quot;
so I remember those nights I used to go to sleep with asking help from &#91; the &#93; Un@@ known because , for some reason , I couldn &apos;t believe what my father and mother han@@ ged in the Pu@@ ja room as a god , because my friend &apos;s family had something else as a god .
I said , &quot; It &apos;s a prize from &#91; an &#93; art competition . &quot;
he would say , &quot; For the greater good . &quot;
so they inhal@@ ed it , but they are not aware of it .
when it &apos;s boun@@ ced on the moon , we see it .
in the &apos; 90s , my interest and passion for transitional art forms led me to a new form , which came from a squatter camp outside D@@ urban .
hurdy-gurdy , or wheel fiddle .
so , these are the different kinds and shapes of the hurdy-gurdy .
it &apos;s also the only instrument that uses this kind of technique .
the first thing that happens is what I call -- a person begins to take on what I call , &quot; special meaning . &quot;
but anyway , not only does this person take on special meaning , you focus your attention on them .
it was : &quot; what percentage of the day and night do you think about this person ? &quot;
and we &apos;re finding more and more and more gender differences in the brain .
they &apos;re highly imaginative .
we now know the brain circuitry of imagination , of long-term planning .
we are seeing the rise of female sexual expression .
they can go together , by the way .
mystery is important . you fall in love with somebody who &apos;s somewhat mysterious , in part because mystery elevates dopamine in the brain , probably pushes you over that threshold to fall in love .
by birth and by choice , I &apos;ve been involved with the auto industry my entire life , and for the past 30 years , I &apos;ve worked at Ford Motor Company .
and as I look back over 30 years ago , it was a little naive to think at that age that I could . but I wanted to .
why do we line up the square milk car@@ ton with the square fence ?
and there &apos;s almost this sort of sem@@ aph@@ ore around us all the time .
children assume permission in a very different way .
it &apos;s about this really .
even in the times of H1N1 , I like the word .
so , in the next eight minutes I would like to share with you my story .
video : &#91; unclear &#93; So , the bu@@ si@@ est streets closed down .
so it also has the ability , all the time , regardless of the direction of the wind , to be able to make the building fresh and efficient .
250 -- excuse me , 50,000 people working 24 hours , seven days .
let me just tell you , briefly , my personal journey , which led me to come to this point .
what the honey bee does : it pollin@@ ates , takes nectar from the flower , pollin@@ ates another flower , cross-@@ pollin@@ ates .
somebody was talking yesterday about Mas@@ lo@@ wian hierarchy .
he meant something like this -- where the light gives direction to the space and helps you to get around .
and there is the idea that , when we look at things , it is the yellow light that helps us the most , that we are the most sensitive for .
we have to think again about light as a default solution .
is it really needed ?
can we be more gentle with light ?
and Henry Ford , just about 100 years ago , started cranking out Model Ts .
I don &apos;t look like a motor vehicle .
and they belong on the sidewalks , and they &apos;ll use it seriously . &quot;
so , I &apos;m happy , really , I am happy to talk about this technology as much as you want .
so I get off , and she gets on , and with a little bit of the usual , ah , then she turns around , and she goes about 20 feet , and she turns back around , and she &apos;s all smiles .
and it &apos;s interesting , when you look at the predictions made during the peak of the boom in the 1990s , about e-@@ commerce , or Internet traffic , or broadband adoption , or Internet advertising , they were all right -- they were just wrong in time .
towards the end of their life , they become nearly free .
today it &apos;s less than 50 cents a day .
free is really , you know , the gift of Silicon Valley to the world .
and their response is dr@@ ac@@ onian , and not necessarily the one that &apos;s going to get them out of this .
even more problematic , they &apos;re not listening to poor people themselves .
and with the money he earned he could stay this year .
our generation has seen both approaches tried , and often fail .
this is me .
and I said to my husband , I said , &quot; Ben , can I buy a banjo ? &quot; and he &apos;s like , &quot; No . &quot;
and then I got people saying , &quot; Leave him . &quot;
this tuna symbolizes what &apos;s the problem for all of us in the room .
we basically are taking the same satellite phone parts , or the same parts that are in your computer , chips .
and so what we &apos;ve done with the science is we &apos;re showing the International Commission , building new models , showing them that a two-@@ stock no-@@ mixing model -- to this day , used to reject the CI@@ TE@@ S treaty -- that model isn &apos;t the right model .
but there goes salmon sharks with this meter-@@ level resolution on an ocean of temperature -- warm colors are warmer .
we need just to apply this capacity further in the oceans .
so I was like , &quot; Maybe you want to ask some of my colleagues that directly . &quot;
and then the phone calls turned into emails , and the emails got longer and longer and longer ...
then I &apos;d make websites .
and after piec@@ ing together this , this and this , this way of actually trying to figure out what happened for myself eventually evolved into this , and it actually became this project .
so how do you know these are meals eaten at home ?
and if I give you this information directly , it &apos;s a very different type of identity than if you were to try to go through and try to get bits and pieces .
kids do worse in the more unequal societies .
it &apos;s simply the proportion of the population who agree most people can be trusted .
well we &apos;ve shown you that GN@@ P per capita doesn &apos;t make any difference .
we &apos;ve got to constra@@ in income , the bonus culture incomes at the top .
there &apos;s legal hustles .
and third of all , it &apos;s so sharp , it just cuts .
and of course , what &apos;s especially good is , if you type &quot; design and emotion , &quot; the first response out of those 10 pages is my website .
and she &apos;d bring them in , and she &apos;d say , &quot; This is an IQ test and it determines how well you do in life .
it &apos;s that little voice in your head that &apos;s watching and saying , &quot; That &apos;s good . that &apos;s bad . &quot;
that seemed a little dam@@ ning , and I tried to correlate it with things like infrastructure , or with the availability of electricity , and things like that .
when you take education and technology , then I find in the literature that , you know , things like websites , collaborative environments -- you &apos;ve been listening to all that in the morning -- it &apos;s always piloted first in the best schools , the best urban schools , and , according to me , biases the result .
and then , as he was doing that , he made an accidental click by hitting the touchpad -- you &apos;ll see him do that .
I left the computer there with lots of CDs -- I didn &apos;t have any Internet -- and came back three months later .
and there , I dealt with things like the Middle East peace process , the Loc@@ ker@@ bie issue -- we can talk about that later , if you wish -- but above all , my responsibility was Iraq and its weapons of mass destruction and the sanctions we placed on Iraq to obli@@ ge it to dis@@ arm itself of these weapons .
I was a single British diplomat in New York City ; you can imagine what that might have meant .
the third reason , I won &apos;t go into .
I can &apos;t actually sit with my foreign minister or my prime minister again with a smile on my face and do what I used to do gl@@ adly for them .
and I came to Kosovo and advised the Kosovo government .
develop new flavors of chewing gum for W@@ rig@@ ley or new flavors for Coke actually helped me innovate new strategies for the Kosovars and for the Sahar@@ aw@@ is of the Western Sahara .
and I began to realize that there are different ways of doing diplomacy -- that diplomacy , like business , is a business of solving problems , and yet the word innovation doesn &apos;t exist in diplomacy ; it &apos;s all zero sum games and real@@ poli@@ ti@@ k and ancient institutions that have been there for generations and do things the same way they &apos;ve always done things .
come back to us in maybe six months . &quot;
the main characters in the story are bacteria and viruses .
once upon a time there &apos;s this happy little bacterium .
but if you &apos;re a virus and you see this , you cross those little legs of yours and you think , &quot; We rock . &quot;
so now you understand how viruses can attack cells .
we had the bursting of the tech bubble .
let &apos;s see , I &apos;d say about three or four percent .
so here &apos;s the metaphor I &apos;m offering today .
and once people circle around some sacred object or value , they &apos;ll then work as a team and fight to defend it .
but really the way to think about this is as multi@@ level selection .
maybe he &apos;ll bad@@ mouth his chief rival to the coach .
somehow or other -- maybe one swallowed another ; we &apos;ll never know exactly why -- but once they got a membrane around them , they were all in the same membrane , now all the weal@@ th-@@ created division of labor , all the greatness created by cooperation , stays locked inside the membrane and we &apos;ve got a superorganism .
and it happened again , even more spectacularly , in the last half-million years when our own ancestors became cultural creatures , they came together around a hear@@ th or a campfire , they divided labor , they began painting their bodies , they spoke their own dialects , and eventually they worshiped their own gods .
it &apos;s about joining with others to pursue moral ideas .
and they really loved their professions .
and the more you try to think about it , the further the answer gets from you , and the minute you stop thinking about it , your intuition gives you that answer , in a sense .
I hate this stuff . it &apos;s hard to read .
&quot; people in the electronic age have no possible environment except the globe , and no possible occupation except information gathering . &quot;
now there &apos;s a plate , and it would be really , really convenient to get a piece of pizza , then type a little bit , then ...
if you ever doubt the power of graphic design , this is a very generic sign that literally says , &quot; V@@ ote for Hitler . &quot; it says nothing else .
so he &apos;s saying , what do genes want ? the selfish gene .
that &apos;s what technology wants .
and there &apos;s a beautiful reef , very complex reef , with lots of animals , including a lot of octopus .
it was like , &quot; I don &apos;t know what that thing is , but he &apos;s no threat to me . &quot;
and one of the most fantastic displays that I remember , or at least visually , was a foraging behavior .
the mid-ocean ridge is a huge mountain range , 40,000 miles long , sna@@ king around the entire globe .
and as these tectonic plates are spreading apart , magma , lava is coming up and filling those gaps , and you &apos;re looking land -- new land -- being created right before your eyes .
you think , &quot; Well , what happened ? &quot;
in theory , we &apos;re thinking , rational human beings .
now my mother was different .
and then also my family was in chaos , and I drew to try to bring my family together -- -- try to bring my family together with laughter .
and I thought , &quot; Well , maybe I can break the little glass ceiling of cartooning , &quot; and so I did . I became a cartoonist .
here &apos;s some numbers .
this 15 percent rule is true no matter where you are on the planet -- Japan , Chile , Portugal , Scotland , doesn &apos;t matter .
if the average age of your population is 30 , then the average kind of disease that you have to treat is maybe a broken an@@ kle every now and again , maybe a little bit of asthma .
and although -- it &apos;s good to laugh before we look at this .
he can actually grow beating tissue in a dish .
this is the same procedure , but now done minimally invasively , with only three holes in the body where they &apos;re taking the heart and simply injecting stem cells through a laparoscopic procedure .
so you could go in , you could get your tum@@ my@@ -@@ tu@@ ck .
everything that is done to treat burn -- basically we do a so@@ dding approach .
isn &apos;t that adorable ?
and we were only 11 years old , so it was not appropriate .
the teacher , Her@@ r Sch@@ top@@ f , he never discrimin@@ ated .
so I think maybe TED , you impact people &apos;s lives in the ways maybe even you don &apos;t realize .
I just -- thank you .
and believe me , these are current pictures .
we had to do these for adults . so , we did succeed and we still do .
we &apos;ve sent 50,000 DVDs to high school teachers in the U.S .
the next day , all the artists were invited to join Mandela in Rob@@ ben Island , where he was going to give a conference to the world &apos;s press , standing in front of his former prison cell .
I have to serve . &quot;
he was wearing a t-shirt like the one I wear now .
and I was showing them my experiences and trying to , again , raise awareness .
and here I am with a pregnant woman , who is HIV positive and we &apos;re smiling , both of us are smiling , because we &apos;re very confident , because we know that that young woman is receiving treatment so her life can be extended to take care of the baby she &apos;s about to give birth to .
the German magazine Stern , a news magazine , had its app censored because the Apple nan@@ nies deemed it to be a little bit too racy for their users , and despite the fact that this magazine is perfectly legal for sale on news@@ stands throughout Germany .
in a pre-@@ Internet world , sovereignty over our physical freedoms , or lack there@@ of , was controlled almost entirely by nation-states .
the most urgent question we need to be asking today is how do we make sure that the Internet evolves in a citiz@@ en-@@ centric manner .
the drugs policy which we &apos;ve had in place for 40 years is long overdue for a very serious rethink , in my opinion .
now , Ar@@ tes@@ un@@ ate is a very effective drug at destroying the parasite in the early days of infection .
nobody has questioned it .
you &apos;ve been constructing fanciful things on top of it , relying on it to be as solid as a rock .
there is only one circumstance in which they always , all of them , walk on two legs , and that is when they are w@@ ading through water .
everybody I talk to says it &apos;s rubbish .
when you do this , don &apos;t attack people ; you attack tactics .
and I like to make devices that play with the ways that we relate and communicate .
I can guarantee , everyone in this room , all of you over there , the people in the cu@@ shy seats , the people up top with the laptops -- we all have bodies .
and so I would put it on and sort of physically transform myself so that I could either contribute to or critique the spaces that surrounded me .
so when we think about scaling up metabolic materials , we can start thinking about ecological interventions like repair of at@@ olls , or recla@@ mation of parts of a city that are damaged by water .
now , this is the very interesting part .
do you know that driving accidents are the number one cause of death for young people ?
nearly every year for more than a hundred years , it &apos;s looked like this in the summer .
because what I was looking for was right in front of my eyes -- in Google , my company .
so what has this got to do with business leadership ?
according to a very comprehensive study led by Jim Collins , and documented in the book &quot; Good to Great , &quot; it takes a very special kind of leader to bring a company from goodness to greatness .
the motivational component of compassion creates ambition for greater good .
but I said to them , &quot; I just have one question , which is , by the time that everybody got to the prosecut@@ or &apos;s office , what had happened to them ? &quot;
and people often say to me , &quot; You know , this is great , but it &apos;s wildly idealistic .
and when you do that , usually you get 80 percent porn and 20 percent real suggestions , and instead it was all -- almost -- all good suggestions .
in Italy , in Milan especially , contemporary art really doesn &apos;t have that much of a place .
I &apos;ve always had a hard time with the word &quot; maverick . &quot;
Tw@@ an Ver@@ don@@ ck is really young , I think he &apos;s 27 , and working together with some psychologist he did a series of toys that are for sensor@@ ial stimulation for children that have psychological impairments .
I wanted to show you , for instance , the work of Ma@@ thieu Le@@ han@@ ne@@ ur , which is quite fantastic .
and I want to tell you that this is my story , OK ?
what are we doing ?
we &apos;ve manually entered all the data there .
and that &apos;s his actual photograph .
so we bring a team together .
and it is all out of carbon fiber .
it really is a story of Dr. Venkat@@ aswamy .
he started this with no money .
Larry Brilliant : he kept talking about McDon@@ al@@ ds and hamburgers , and none of it made any sense to us .
the revenues increase at a higher level , giving us a healthy margin while you &apos;re treating a large number of people for free .
but this really requires going beyond what we do , or what we have done , if you really want to achieve solving this problem of blindness .
maybe there is -- the solution to the cost could be in productivity , maybe in efficiency , in the clinical process , or in how much they pay for the lenses or consum@@ ables , or regulations , their defensive practice .
TR : thank you very much .
so let me show you the shape-@@ changing mobile .
again , it &apos;s a mobile phone-@@ shaped box , and this one can change its shape .
it &apos;s like tap@@ ered to the downside .
think of a ham@@ ster in the pocket .
I &apos;d seen my life slip away and become restricted .
just being out on the street was exhilarating .
for me , this means that they &apos;re seeing the value of difference , the joy it brings when instead of focusing on loss or limitation , we see and discover the power and joy of seeing the world from exciting new perspectives .
now they &apos;re showing us how they do their phone service .
furthermore , people in the informal economy , the gray economy -- as time goes by , crime is happening around them . and they can join the criminal world , or they can join the legitimate world .
connectivity between the city and the country is what &apos;s going to keep the country good , because the city has interesting ways of doing things .
and that will determine a lot of how we function .
it &apos;s interesting , say , to take a 25-@@ megawatt , 25 million watts , and you compare it to the standard big iron of an ordinary West@@ in@@ gh@@ ouse or Ari@@ va , which is 1.2 , 1.6 billion watts .
and by the way , the assumption that we can safely control the Earth &apos;s awe@@ some@@ ly complex climate system as if it had a thermostat , making the planet not too hot , not too cold , but just right -- sort of Goldilocks style -- this is pure fantasy , and it &apos;s not coming from the climate scientists .
you know , just stop for a moment , imagine all those noises , this thing , &quot; C@@ lick , cl@@ ack click click click , &quot; steam engine , &quot; D@@ ing , &quot; right ?
14th Man : let &apos;s say that you and me like each other .
Barry Friedman : there are all kinds of high-tech chairs here today , but this is really , I think , when it reached its peak as far as ergon@@ omics , comfort , design , flexibility ...
BF : you know , sometimes when people do those , they go all the way down .
right now , Dan &apos;s going to show something he actually invented .
DH : now Richard , please ...
BF : no , come stay up with him .
DH : one more , one more .
even the pencil .
BF : well , you know ...
DH : that &apos;s a pretty good setup , Richard .
BF : Seven@@ -@@ club juggling .
well folks , I &apos;m here to tell you that the world has completely changed and none of you know about it .
so now what we do is we take a genome , we make maybe 50 copies of it , we cut all those copies up into little 50-@@ base reads , and then we sequence them , massively parallel .
what does this mean for medicine ?
and what they find is a single-@@ point mutation in a gene responsible for controlling programmed cell death .
hands it back to me . and we do that again and again .
most of us are familiar with electrons .
when we include these , each matter particle has two different spin charges , spin-@@ up and spin-@@ down .
one does a lot of hard work knowing that most of these ideas probably won &apos;t end up being true about nature .
but I also greatly enjoy the company of hyper-intelligent people .
and every group chooses , between them , three different kinds of project to make this a better world , recognizing that all these different problems are interconnected and imp@@ inge on each other .
you can take an area that &apos;s absolutely destroyed , with time and perhaps some help it can regenerate .
I began talking with people who actually had been out to the gyre and were studying the plastic problem in the marine environment and upon doing so , I realized actually that cleaning it up would be a very small drop in the bucket relative to how much is being generated every day around the world , and that actually I needed to back up and look at the bigger picture .
you put something in a bin and you don &apos;t have to think about it again .
I suffered a lot as a mother .
it &apos;s up to us women , because we are women , because we love our children .
then we sat in a circle with support , with help , from people experienced in this kind of reconciliation .
would you like to see that ?
there we go . mind the electr@@ ics .
and where , at the nation state level that power is held to accountability subject to the rule of law , on the international stage it is not .
Dan Bu@@ ett@@ ner : how to live to be 100 +
and predictably , perhaps , on the fourth day he ended up in the operating room .
there &apos;s no longevity diet .
so I &apos;m going to place this on a hot plate that is set to a temperature only slightly higher than ambient and you can see what happens .
so I &apos;m a social scientist by training , so why am I here today talking about smart materials ?
secondly , and just as important , innovation has always been fueled by tin@@ ker@@ ers .
you &apos;re in this extended body .
but occasionally we miss something .
and same with the other cars .
that guy could be a problem .
if one guy has a really great car , but they &apos;re on their phone or , you know , doing something , they &apos;re not probably in the best position to react in an emergency .
we can predict the accident and we can predict who , which cars , are in the best position to move out of the way to calculate the safest route for everyone .
I think the biggest problem that we face is our own willingness to share our data .
it &apos;s going to make the roads a lot safer .
we had one government agency and one company aircraft operator say , you &apos;re crazy , don &apos;t do that , you &apos;re going kill the guy .
we took off from the shuttle landing facility , where the shuttle takes off and lands .
so basically , no one would accept family planning if their children didn &apos;t survive .
in all this thing , from seven children to 1.5 children , population growth rate of 3.3 to 0.5 .
everybody joins in , and they feel they own the bank , because they have brought the money in .
K@@ eller Rin@@ au@@ do : a mini robot -- powered by your phone
my measurements .
I need maver@@ icks , dissidents , adventur@@ ers , outsiders and rebels , who ask questions , bend the rules and take risks .
when she was 14 years old , her grandfather sold her to a bro@@ thel .
I was born in ancient times , at the end of the world , in a patriarchal Catholic and conservative family .
although women do two-thirds of the world &apos;s labor , they own less than one percent of the world &apos;s assets .
I think that the time is ripe to make fundamental changes in our civilization .
and more importantly , what are we going to do about it ?
and it was also fertile .
what would an al@@ leg@@ ory of good government look like today ?
we need to realize that the world is also what we eat .
education because we &apos;ve so dropped out of compassion .
thank you very much .
who knew about extension managers ?
eventually , I realized that I had really no content that I could count on , so I decided to move towards packaging .
everybody knows Car@@ let@@ to , because he &apos;s in entertainment , actually ; he &apos;s in television .
but more importantly , I could also show you what it looks like at the corner of one of those magnificent buildings with all the massive stone blocks , or the fake stone blocks done with brick and stuc@@ co , which is more often the case .
no fol@@ dou@@ ts , no tricks -- just a book that isn &apos;t open the whole way .
&quot; pigeon &apos;s Pro@@ gress &quot; struck me as a cat@@ chy title .
and then it gives you an output in 3D space .
and now it starts moving in three-dimensional space -- so up or down .
at first we thought that perhaps this was artifact .
in those galaxies , you &apos;ll be able to do astrophysics , and learn the laws of physics .
the president has seen how those rules worked well .
and he says that if you want to see the damaging effects of rules , the ways that rules can keep people in the dark , look at the pictures from NASA of the earth at night .
Chinese had pioneered technologies like steel , printing , gunpowder .
you &apos;ll need to attract firms , who will come hire the people who move there first .
we also need the choices for people .
if you move the dots down to the bottom of the rectangle you can see that the cities for the existing three billion urban residents take up only three percent of the arable land on earth .
you could use the gains on the value of the land to pay for things like the police , the courts , but the school system and the health care system too , which make this a more attractive place to live , makes this a place where people have higher incomes -- which , incidentally , makes the land more valuable .
and we think in a gen@@ e-@@ centric view -- maybe going back to Richard Dawkins &apos; ideas -- than in a genom@@ e-@@ centric view , which are different constructs of these gene components .
so what is time perspective ? that &apos;s what I &apos;m going to talk about today .
so that their decisions are based on past memories .
in fact , just studying the rings alone , we stand to learn a lot about the disc@@ s of stars and gas that we call the spiral galaxies .
it was so mysti@@ fying : we couldn &apos;t make out what we were seeing on Titan .
.
the U.N. wanted to rush people and supplies to the area .
but there were no maps , no maps of roads , no maps showing hospitals , no way for help to reach the cy@@ clone victims .
if they multiply , their influence will grow in the overall Isra@@ eli@@ -@@ Palestinian conflict .
year after year , after year , after year , they &apos;re more innovative than all their competition .
and yet , they &apos;re just a computer company .
zero .
so the cell on the left , you can see , it fires whenever the animal gets near to a wall or a boundary to the east , whether it &apos;s the edge or the wall of a square box or the circular wall of the circular box or even the drop at the edge of a table , which the animals are running around .
and place cells also get this kind of path integration input from a kind of cell called a grid cell .
another kind of cell , head direction cells , which I didn &apos;t mention yet , they fire like a compass according to which way you &apos;re facing .
imagine a global security driven by collaboration -- among agencies , government , the private sector and the public . that &apos;s not just the distant hope of open-source fans , it &apos;s the vision of James Sta@@ v@@ ri@@ dis , the Supreme Commander of NATO , who shares vivid moments from recent military history to explain why security of the future should be built with bridges rather than walls .
this is a famous bridge in Europe .
it &apos;s in Bos@@ ni@@ a-@@ Her@@ ze@@ go@@ v@@ ina .
I would argue , again , open-source security is about connecting the international , the interagency , the private-public , and la@@ shing it together with strategic communication , largely in social networks .
this is part of cybercrime which is a $ 2-@@ trilli@@ on-@@ a-year dis@@ continuity in the global economy .
you would be correct .
purple are tweets . green are geo@@ location .
