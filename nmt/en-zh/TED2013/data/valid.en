and that &apos;s the difference between a PC@@ B and , say , something natural like an ome@@ ga@@ -@@ 3 , something we want out of the marine food chain .
we &apos;ve taken them out of their natural pyramid in order to solve this problem .
these are two shots of a red tide coming on shore here and a bacteria in the gen@@ us vi@@ brio , which includes the gen@@ us that has cholera in it .
BJ : so every moment it &apos;s on the stage , it &apos;s making the struggle .
BJ : and here again , you see the same structure .
and we went back to Cape Town and redesigned the horse completely .
the way a ho@@ of comes up with a horse immediately gives you the feeling that it &apos;s a convincing horse action .
Adrian thought that he was going to have to split the chest of the puppet in two and make it breathe like that -- because that &apos;s how a horse would breathe , with an expanded chest .
it can make a mountain go from this to this in a few short months .
now mountaintop removal pays very little money to the locals , and it gives them a lot of misery .
not quite an obvious alliance .
in fact , they make up some of what I call the most expensive citizens , and they include gener@@ ationally impoverished , traumatized vets returning from the Middle East , people coming out of jail .
it is an essential pillar to this country &apos;s recovery .
to him that phrase , &quot; Char@@ ity begins at home , &quot; meant that my pay@@ day -- or someone else &apos;s -- would just happen to coinci@@ de with his lucky day .
but I did in fact get married in it .
and probably , if I were to fill out Jim Cit@@ r@@ in &apos;s scale , I &apos;d put 100 percent on the side of the equation where you spend time making it possible for others to be creative .
kids don &apos;t program enough and boy , if there &apos;s anything I hope this brings back , it &apos;s programming to kids .
there is no keyboard standard because there &apos;s no market .
and so what happens is , these things start to happen with these countries -- still not enough .
and that &apos;s where I think it &apos;s very important . I don &apos;t want you all to go out and buy 400 dollars worth of laptops . okay ? do it , but that &apos;s not going to help . okay ?
but what I &apos;m here to talk to you about today is how that same interdependence is actually an extremely powerful social infrastructure that we can actually harness to help heal some of our deepest civic issues , if we apply open source collaboration .
fast-forward two years later : we now have window farms , which are vertical , hydrop@@ onic platforms for food-@@ growing indoors .
so for do-it-@@ your@@ sel@@ fers , we provide free , very well-@@ tested instructions so that anyone , anywhere around the world , can build one of these systems for free .
but we did go into all the surrounding buildings that had been evacu@@ ated , and searched for possible survivors in the buildings that were too dangerous to go into .
so one year ago , the US military didn &apos;t have these robots .
here we &apos;ve got naive subjects p@@ raising the robot : voice : nice robot .
voice : look at my smile .
RB : so she realizes she has the robot &apos;s attention .
and we &apos;ve had the retreat from special-@@ ness under the barrage of science and technology many times over the last few hundred years , at least .
500 years ago we had to give up the idea that we are the center of the universe when the earth started to go around the sun ; 150 years ago , with Darwin , we had to give up the idea we were different from animals .
and when I picture how Democrats and Demo@@ cra@@ tic-@@ leaning economists picture this economy , most Democratic economists are , you know , they &apos;re capitalists , they believe , yes , that &apos;s a good system a lot of the time .
the vast majority want to protect military defense spending .
so how do we make that actually work ?
is it beautiful now ?
I &apos;m feeling it here . I feel it here .
and as a designer , I can &apos;t help me@@ ddling with this , so I pulled it to bits and sort of did stuff like this , and tried to understand what the individual elements were , but feeling it as I go .
and to cap it all , brand roy@@ alty -- Agu@@ sta , Count Agu@@ sta , from the great histories of this stuff .
one is a pr@@ int-@@ on-demand machine that looks like a Rube Goldberg machine .
and we sort of picked the price point of 10 cents a page .
we tended towards longer-term things and also things that people can reuse and make into new movies , which has just been great fun .
were they ? let &apos;s look at the Palestinian television and find out .
how can we have critical thinking without being able to quote and being able to compare what happened in the past ?
so , we should put it in the San Andre@@ as F@@ ault Line in San Francisco , flood zone in Amsterdam and in the Middle East . right , so anyway ...
and what the Russians are doing is they &apos;re building these detectors and immer@@ sing them about a kilometer beneath the surface of the lake so that they can watch for these fla@@ shes of blue light .
so this is the Russians working on the ice in the peak of the Siberian winter .
this is cosmology &apos;s final frontier .
and you barely might be able to make out this hut here .
this hut was built by Robert Falcon Scott and his men when they first came to Antarctica on their first expedition to go to the South Pole .
it &apos;s an extraordinary place .
I often wondered , if there was a United Organization of Organ@@ isms -- otherwise known as &quot; U@@ h-@@ Oh &quot; -- -- and every organism had a right to vote , would we be voted on the planet , or off the planet ?
we exhale carbon dioxide , so does mycelium .
how is it that this organism can be so large , and yet be one cell wall thick , whereas we have five or six skin layers that protect us ?
I add mycelium to it , and then I inocul@@ ate the corn@@ co@@ bs .
so what did I learn ? well , here I am inside Biosphere 2 , making a pizza .
and those sweet potatoes became part of me .
and on Sunday morning the neighbors leaf blower comes out , and I want to throttle them .
it &apos;s a certain type of aesthetic .
maybe there is a little bit of oxygen from some algae on the beach not far from here .
our medical systems are broken . doctors are capable of extraordinary treatments , but they are losing their core focus : actually treating people . doctor and writer A@@ tu@@ l Ga@@ wan@@ de suggests we take a step back and look at new ways to do medicine -- with fewer cowboys and more pit crews .
go a couple generations forward to where we are , though , and it looks like a completely different world .
we &apos;re all specialists now , even the primary care physicians .
he &apos;s the one who first identified this condition and raised the alarm bells .
I &apos;ve had the privilege of living by a meadow for the last little while , and it is terribly engaging .
some of them are about the animals , the number .
and this problem is : where are the plants ?
this is on the 6 train in New York City .
and watch her make eye contact with them right about now .
the second signal was for everybody to do J@@ um@@ ping j@@ acks together .
there were several other activities .
so we had been there for 20 minutes ; we were happy to exit the store .
I don &apos;t think so .
they &apos;re a sort of ec@@ tos@@ ym@@ bi@@ ont .
the designs discovered by the process of natural selection are brilliant , unbelievably brilliant .
this is a million people gathering on the banks of the Ganges in 2001 , perhaps the largest single gathering of human beings ever , as seen from satellite photograph .
they &apos;d want to know how it originated , what it was for and how it perpetuates itself .
for instance , he has an app@@ en@@ dix where he explains his choice of translations of different Bible verses .
despite the heavy gun@@ fire , I &apos;ve been able to get away from it all and walk through the land of your ideas . &quot;
he thought nature would protect us from their formation .
we would see a shadow of that black hole against the hundred billion stars in the Milky Way Galaxy and its luminous dust lanes .
you would literally hear the sound .
but it comes in like a mal@@ let , and it literally cracks space , wobbling it like a drum .
galaxies form , and generations of stars form in those galaxies , and around one star , at least one star , is a habitable planet .
this is Mr. L@@ opez , who has been in solitary confin@@ ement for 18 months , and he &apos;s providing input on the types of images that he believes would make him and his fellow inmates more serene , more calm , less ap@@ t to violence .
and the wholeness is the reality of you when you relate to the world .
if you know how to pray , pray .
then , one night , the scene changes .
and she has a sense of humor .
so on one occasion , when his grand@@ daughters were visiting them , he said , &quot; And who are these handsome young men with you ? &quot;
and you start to see things .
the Charles Bonnet ones are quite different .
well , I &apos;ve more or less said what I wanted .
now , 250 years later , I think we &apos;re beginning to glimpse how this is done .
the Khan Academy is most known for its collection of videos , so before I go any further , let me show you a little bit of a mon@@ tage .
and that &apos;s what was happening with the interaction with my cousins before , and now they can just do it in the intimacy of their own room .
and then a few other things started to dawn on me .
what it does is -- and this is what &apos;s happening in Los Altos -- it frees up time .
I &apos;m still doing all the videos , but we have a rockstar team doing the software .
it &apos;s actually been pretty interesting .
BG : is this ready for prime time ?
so it &apos;s a little-@@ appreciated fact that most of the animals in our ocean make light .
so I just want to show you some of the responses we &apos;ve elic@@ ited from animals in the deep sea .
there &apos;s supposed to be something else there . &quot;
and you might like to hear some of the principles that I &apos;ve developed in doing that teaching and counseling .
I was very much inspired by this image many years ago , and I wondered whether we could use computer graphics to represent the molecular world .
neither one wants to be the first one or they &apos;re going to get the suc@@ ker &apos;s payoff , but both lose , of course , because they don &apos;t get what they want .
so I enlist you to help me get the cooperation project started .
Blaise Agu@@ era y Ar@@ cas demos aug@@ men@@ ted-@@ reality maps
so , the first thing that you might notice about the mapping site is just the fluidity of the zooming and the pan@@ ning , which , if you &apos;re familiar at all with Se@@ ad@@ rag@@ on , that &apos;s where it comes from .
this is a picture of my family , my four siblings -- my mom and I -- taken in 1977 .
and people had hope , yes , but until they realized their situation wor@@ sen@@ s every day -- either because they are being killed or because , somehow , they are poorer than eight years ago .
and partly this is already happening .
I thought it was an idea worth spreading , and I think it must be , can be , could be replicated elsewhere .
I had received a donation of 50 music stands to be used by 100 boys in that rehearsal .
JA : here is my TED Prize wish : I wish that you &apos;ll help to create and document a special training program for 50 gifted young musicians , passionate about their art and social justice , and dedicated to bringing El Sistema to the United States and other countries .
in this rather long sort of marathon presentation , I &apos;ve tried to break it up into three parts : the first being a whole lot of examples on how it can be a little bit more pleasurable to deal with a computer and really address the qualities of the human interface .
I &apos;m very interested in touch-@@ sensitive displays .
we never succeeded in using ten fingers , but there are certain things you can do , obviously , with more than one-@@ finger input , which is rather fascinating .
I want to move on to another example , which is one of a different sort , where we &apos;re trying to use computer and video disc technology now to come up with a new kind of book .
and the movie is displayed as a full frame movie .
our entire health reform discussion right now , health I.@@ T. , when we talk with policy makers , equals &quot; How are we going to get doctors using electronic medical records in the mainframe ? &quot;
it &apos;s about a year &apos;s worth of data .
that &apos;s what &apos;s in fields around the world every single year .
this is the result of my hobby , which is unoff@@ icial bin inspec@@ tions .
but this is what you can see more or less on every street corner in Britain , in Europe , in North America .
and it happened to be at a time when people were just starting to begin to realize that dinosaurs weren &apos;t the big , stupid , green reptiles that people had thought for so many years .
and then Steven Spielberg , of course , depicts these dinosaurs as being very social creatures .
we found a lot of Tyrannos@@ aurs , but we found one special Tyrannos@@ aur , and we called it B-rex .
it was actually interesting that such a communist principle was the basis of a system developed during the Cold War by the Defense Department , but it obviously worked really well , and we all saw what happened with the Internet .
now , in fact , they couldn &apos;t do it for a lot of reasons today .
these are some of the names that they have chosen , ladies and gentlemen .
then to Ni@@ li@@ acus L@@ acus , which is not a bad name .
&quot; listen , I &apos;m going back to the swamp mermaid . can you call me in a little while ? &quot;
and within numbers , is there an underlying secret to the universe ?
so , I &apos;m thinking the universe is either a dodecahedron or a cheese@@ burger .
this is again , indicating how numbers relate to space relate to form , maps of the universe .
but I &apos;d say he &apos;d been to Hel@@ le@@ spo@@ in@@ tica De@@ pres@@ sio recently .
but I &apos;d like to relay to you a childhood experience of mine that really made me see the ocean differently , and it &apos;s become the foundation of my work because , I feel like , if in a day , I can see the ocean differently , then I can evoke that same kind of change in others , especially kids .
I ended that series with a kind of a ma@@ il-@@ in petition that encouraged our National Marine Fish@@ ery Service , to force other countries to have a stronger stance with shark management .
I &apos;ve been trying to think of a metaphor to represent Mission Blue , and this is what I came up with .
and you take the piece out into the daylight .
I won &apos;t be taking you to the high Arctic , the life of the Inuit , or to the searing sands of the Sahara .
men , women and children of all ages , elders in wheelchairs , have block@@ aded the only road access to the interior .
in a lively show , mathe@@ magician Arthur Benjamin races a team of calculators to figure out 3-@@ digit squares , solves another massive mental equation and guesses a few birth@@ days . how does he do it ? he &apos;ll tell you .
by any chance , did anyone happen to bring with them this morning a calculator ?
what I &apos;ll use is the second row this time , and I &apos;ll get four of you -- one , two , three , four -- to each yell out a two-digit number , and if you would square the first number , and if you would square the second , the third and the fourth , I will try and race you to the answer . OK ?
I &apos;m going to break the problem down into three parts .
this is a phon@@ etic code , a m@@ ne@@ mon@@ ic device that I use , that allows me to convert numbers into words .
I hope you enjoyed mathe@@ mag@@ ics . thank you .
a third time , it &apos;s just being a technician .
I &apos;d love to talk about it , it &apos;d be fun , but I want to talk about what I &apos;m doing now . what am I doing now ?
in the background , my bicycle .
I &apos;ve decided that , for me at least , I don &apos;t have a big enough head .
I &apos;d love to measure the speed of light here .
so , in order to measure the speed of sound , all I &apos;ve got to do is know its frequency . well , that &apos;s easy .
all I need now is to flip on another beam , and the bottom beam is me talking , right ?
so anytime I talk , you &apos;d see it on the screen .
I &apos;m walking across campus . cop comes and looks at me and says , &quot; You ! you &apos;re a student . &quot;
pulls out a gun . goes boom !
we want space efficiency .
would that give me a little more freedom ?
if we &apos;ve got them wired up with an electroencephalogram , the right brain of each of them becomes att@@ uned , so that the joyful emergence of this earliest of play scenes and the physiology of that is something we &apos;re beginning to get a handle on .
but curiosity , exploration , are part of the play scene .
and we begin to lose those signals , culturally and otherwise , as adults .
JH : Stuart Brown , thank you very much .
this is made from three ingredients : be@@ ets , barley , corn , and so it actually cooks up like hamburger meat , looks and tastes like hamburger meat , and not only that , but it &apos;s basically removing the cow from the equation .
Pat@@ rice and Pate@@ e have been out for hours but found nothing .
every person who has one of those filter papers has at least , at a minimum , been through our basic health education about the risks associated with these activities , which presumably , from our perspective , gives them the ability to decrease their own risk , and then obviously the risk to their families , the village , the country , and the world .
OK ? and you can consider all sorts of different bush meat .
and here &apos;s a shot of me , this is the before shot of me .
so let &apos;s run this and see if it works .
and in my case , when I hit send , up to 60,000 people will receive that message in a matter of seconds .
now , the fundamental idea is that Twitter lets people share moments of their lives whenever they want , be they momentous occasions or mundane ones .
so , thank you very much , Evan .
and when I didn &apos;t finish my dinner my mother would say , &quot; Fin@@ ish your food ! don &apos;t you know ? people like Fide &apos;s family have nothing . &quot;
the single story creates stereotypes , and the problem with stereotypes is not that they are un@@ true , but that they are incomplete .
the results were quite extraordinary .
it recently came out that experts tri@@ aling drugs before they come to market typically trial drugs first , primarily on male animals and then , primarily on men .
now , it may sound as though I &apos;m about to preach atheism , and I want to reassure you that that &apos;s not what I &apos;m going to do .
he begins this speech which was tap@@ e-@@ recorded in Cambridge shortly before he died .
she clearly feels in a b@@ ele@@ agu@@ ered minority , but actually , how do American atheists stack up numerically ?
in most cases , people who out themselves will help to destroy the myth that there is something wrong with atheists .
on the contrary , they &apos;ll demonstrate that atheists are often the kinds of people that could serve as decent role models for your children , the kinds of people an advertising agent could use to recommend a product , the kinds of people who are sitting in this room .
so I went out and resear@@ ched ethanol , and found out you need the Amazon in your backyard in every country .
and not from the power of an e@@ dict down .
remember in your car you have a gas tank .
we were asked in the past when we bought an electric car to pay for the entire well , for the life of the car .
that &apos;s cheaper than today &apos;s gasoline , even in the U.S .
it &apos;s inver@@ sely proportional to taxes .
he decided that he &apos;s going to take over the state , unoff@@ icially , and then officially , and then created this beautiful Re@@ gi@@ on One policy .
it &apos;s called the other car .
we looked at an MIT study : ten million electric cars on the global roads .
no infrastructure , no problem .
we can invite partners who can support us , but we have to start .
when President O@@ bas@@ an@@ jo supported and launched the liber@@ alization of the telecommunications sector , we went from 4,500 landlines to 32 million G@@ SM lines , and counting .
conflicts are down on the continent ; from about 12 conflicts a decade ago , we are down to three or four conflicts -- one of the most terrible , of course , of which is Darfur .
10,000 , two and a half million , 15 years .
now , let me tell you a different story . around June 2002 , the world of supercomputers had a bomb@@ shell .
so , I &apos;m here to trumpet vaccines for you .
narrator : a vaccine trains the body in advance how to recognize and neutralize a specific inv@@ ader .
now , in the 27 years since HIV was identified as the cause of AIDS , we &apos;ve developed more drugs to treat HIV than all other viruses put together .
so , the challenge is full speed ahead .
education is the main event that can happen in cities .
there are certain things that we need to recognize .
if it &apos;s not , it &apos;s certainly affecting their eggs and larvae , I would certainly think .
if you look around at the birds , there are a lot of birds in the Gulf that concentrate in the Gulf at certain times of the year , but then leave .
and they pop@@ ulate much larger areas .
the first offshore drills were called har@@ po@@ ons .
but the thing is that you don &apos;t decide what gets in .
and to find the connectomes of brains more like our own , we need more sophisticated technologies , that are automated , that will speed up the process of finding connectomes .
for now , let me try to convince you of the plausibility of this hypothesis , that it &apos;s actually worth taking seriously .
it &apos;s like the water of the stream ; it never sits still .
but it won &apos;t be easy , because they &apos;re not going to look like this .
resurrection might succeed for the body , but not for the mind .
if you come to my apartment and see my closet , I &apos;m sure you &apos;d figure out why : it &apos;s a mess .
KS : seeing the unexpected properties and then seeing a couple of applications -- it helps you see why this is significant , what the potential is .
foie gras and the future of cooking .
and the rest of the year they &apos;re free to ro@@ am around Eduardo &apos;s land and eat what they want .
and the geese love the L@@ up@@ in bush .
that &apos;s also an insult to history .
and what he showed me and what he can show all of us , I think , is that the great thing for chefs , the great blessing for chefs , and for people that care about food and cooking , is that the most ecological choice for food is also the most ethical choice for food .
we will find that these children , too , have a real chance of breaking their way out of poverty .
can you imagine ? it &apos;s very symbolic .
there is some danger , there is some trap . one trap : the vertical .
the modern tools of neuroscience are demonstrating to us that what &apos;s going on up there is nothing short of rocket science .
they can discriminate all the sounds of all languages , no matter what country we &apos;re testing and what language we &apos;re using , and that &apos;s remarkable because you and I can &apos;t do that .
we had to run a control group to make sure that just coming into the laboratory didn &apos;t improve your Mandarin skills .
everything was going bad .
this is not the end , this is the beginning of the end . &quot;
thank God I announced the locations and everything .
compassion has many faces .
so we can ask : what is compassion comprised of ?
part of me thinks I should have a nuclear program , the other part thinks I can &apos;t be trusted with one .
then he opened it up . &quot; born in Iran ? wait . &quot;
thought the guy was going to come back and be like , &quot; We &apos;ve been looking for you for 200 years . &quot;
like I think you &apos;re missing the point here .
out of my way . out of my way . out of my way . &quot;
I bought five grams . 10 dollars . 10 dollars ! I said , &quot; What &apos;s in this ? &quot;
and I &apos;ve taken my two year-old son to play@@ grounds all over the United States .
which is why in this vast and lonely cosmos , we are so wonderfully optimistic .
thank you . thank you very much .
in fact , I read it in the newspaper .
all the other countries , for example the United Kingdom , can borrow only against the amount of money in circulation inside its own borders .
so , here is the implication of the relationship between the worlds of crime , terror , and illegal economy , and our economy .
oars are not supposed to look like this .
I really struggled psychologically , totally overwhelmed by the scale of the challenge , realizing that , if I carried on moving at two miles an hour , 3,000 miles was going to take me a very , very long time .
it &apos;s meant to be a bit of a game .
so this is another one dedicated to that guy ...
and those are the pieces of wood . those are the instructions .
when I was a kid , I hid my heart under the bed , because my mother said , &quot; If you &apos;re not careful , someday someone &apos;s going to break it . &quot;
they &apos;re standing alone at the high school dance , and they &apos;ve never been kissed .
turns out it &apos;s not that hard to trick someone , and one day before class , I said , &quot; Yeah , you can copy my homework , &quot; and I gave him all the wrong answers that I &apos;d written down the night before .
I knew I didn &apos;t have to hold up my paper of 28 out of 30 , but my satisfaction was complete when he looked at me , puzzled , and I thought to myself , &quot; Smar@@ ter than the average bear , motherfuc@@ ker . &quot;
but in fact , if you reversed the figure ground -- in other words , the dark areas here -- I forgot to ask for a pointer -- but if you reverse it , you &apos;ll see a whole series of little dolphins . by the way , if you &apos;re also a student at Cal@@ Tech -- they also tend to just see the dolphins . it &apos;s based on experience .
within that sphere , most of those nodes are not ac@@ tionable , like the harsh@@ ness of the terrain , and a very small minority are actual military actions .
they help us stay connected with people in our social network that we would otherwise grow distant from , if we weren &apos;t playing games together .
and Stanford University has been doing research for five years now to document how playing a game with an idealized avatar changes how we think and act in real life , making us more courageous , more ambitious , more committed to our goals .
things like cu@@ ddling my dog for 10 minutes , or getting out of bed and walking around the block just once .
but even when I still had the symptoms , even while I was still in pain , I stopped suffering .
all you have to do is successfully complete the first four Super@@ Better qu@@ ests .
if you &apos;re inside , find a window and look out of it .
sloth , giraffe , elephant , snake . okay , let &apos;s see what we got .
got that ?
and I went home , and I told my sister Christine .
now some of you are sitting here thinking , &quot; What planet are these people on ?
Vs Ram@@ ach@@ and@@ ran on your mind
I mean , you know it &apos;s you because you win@@ k and it win@@ ks , and you know it &apos;s a mirror , but you don &apos;t really recognize yourself as yourself .
thank God , or you would all be sexually aroused when you saw your mother .
and you say , &quot; My God , if this is my mom , how come I &apos;m being sexually turned on ?
but he &apos;s not stupid . he knows it &apos;s not real .
&quot; so , can you change the design and put it on my forehead , so I can , you know , do this and eliminate my phantom fingers ? &quot;
now , this is very important , because what it &apos;s telling you is your brain is engaging in a primitive -- it &apos;s just -- it looks like a silly illusion , but these photons in your eye are doing this shape , and hair cells in your ear are exciting the auditory pattern , but the brain is able to extract the common denominator .
and what we try to do in astronomy and cosmology is to go back before Darwin &apos;s simple beginning , to set our Earth in a cosmic context .
and we can see places where stars are forming , like the Eagle Ne@@ bula . we see stars dying .
if my research group had a logo , it would be this picture here : an ou@@ ro@@ bor@@ os , where you see the micro-@@ world on the left -- the world of the quantum -- and on the right the large-scale universe of planets , stars and galaxies .
and so what this means is that we have to accept the risks if we are going to enjoy the benefits of science .
you can get it out .
what is she writing ?
we &apos;re learning how to communicate with them , in really high-@@ pitched tones .
so that instead of spending it the way you usually spend it , maybe if you spent it differently , that might work a little bit better .
and we manipulated how much money we gave them .
people who spent money on other people got happier .
so for example , one guy from Uganda says this .
but Sputnik provoked wonderful changes as well .
maybe you thought that was scary , but actually there &apos;s no amount of drugs you can take that can get you as high as if you think you &apos;re Jesus Christ .
how much depends on how lucky you are .
some trained musicians out there .
it &apos;s beautiful . the birds are , we sort of understand , we think , from that computer model , what &apos;s going on .
these cables were on the side of the bridge , like if you took a rubber band and stretched it t@@ au@@ t across the Thames -- that &apos;s what &apos;s holding up this bridge .
I figured he was either really on to something , or he was one of these academic nut@@ cases .
so if I were to going to show you all the beans in the world , and I had a slide like this , and I switched it every second , it would take up my entire TED talk , and I wouldn &apos;t have to say anything .
you don &apos;t look in the eyes of a carrot seed quite in the way you do a panda bear , but it &apos;s very important diversity .
except in a few special circumstances : in women , blood vessels grow every month to build the lining of the uterus ; during pregnancy , they form the placenta , which connects mom and baby .
and this is actually how a cancer goes from being harmless to deadly .
and here are some common drugs that have been associated with reducing the risk of cancer in people .
in the other game the cars can only move forward and back .
and it has to be solvable in a magazine .
there we are . visit Shuff@@ le@@ Bra@@ in@@ .com if you want to try it yourself . thank you .
I want to talk a little bit about the Democratic Republic of Congo .
I want to say that I think the powers that be know that em@@ pi@@ re-@@ building is actually -- that feelings get in the way of em@@ pi@@ re-@@ building .
and in that time she saved many girls . and when we met her we asked her what we could do for her , and she said , &quot; Well , if you got me a Jeep I could get around a lot faster . &quot;
she slept with the hyenas . she hid at night .
so I got a Fulbright scholarship to just travel around Africa for a year asking people why they were building fractals , which is a great job if you can get it .
you can see on the pottery and the baskets .
you can find it on the East Coast as well as the West Coast , and often the symbols are very well preserved , so each of these symbols has four bits -- it &apos;s a four-@@ bit binary word -- you draw these lines in the sand randomly , and then you count off , and if it &apos;s an odd number , you put down one stroke , and if it &apos;s an even number , you put down two strokes .
now , because it &apos;s a binary code , you can actually implement this in hardware -- what a fantastic teaching tool that should be in African engineering schools .
Leibniz , the German mathematician , talked about ge@@ om@@ ancy in his dissertation called &quot; De Com@@ bin@@ at@@ oria . &quot;
so it &apos;s really very successful teaching children that they have a heritage that &apos;s about mathematics , that it &apos;s not just about singing and dancing .
and finally , I just wanted to point out that this idea of self-organization , as we heard earlier , it &apos;s in the brain .
now , here &apos;s the bad news .
he read 30 years of Harvard Business Re@@ view before stumbling upon an article in 1986 called &quot; The New New Pro@@ duct Development Game . &quot;
I met a celebrity chef in New Orleans who said , &quot; No problem , I &apos;ll just time-@@ shift family dinner .
the answer , I believe , is yes .
it makes &quot; The Da@@ Vinci Code &quot; seem like &quot; War and Peace . &quot;
what we discovered is whether you look at the leg of a human like Richard , or a cockroach , or a crab , or a kangaroo , the relative leg sti@@ ff@@ ness of that spring is the same for everything we &apos;ve seen so far .
it has the middle leg moving in synchrony with the front , and the hind leg on the other side . sort of an altern@@ ating tri@@ pod , and they can negotiate obstacles just like the animal .
RF : here &apos;s it going down a pathway .
the animal does not use that .
my talk today is about what the messages are if you do want to stay in the workforce , and I think there are three .
number one : sit at the table .
who do you think drops out when someone needs to be home more ?
she starts leaning back .
one woman came to see me about this , and I kind of looked at her -- she looked a little young .
and doctors hate it , right ?
when you give people specific information about their health , where they stand , and where they want to get to , where they might get to , that path , that notion of a path -- that tends to work for behavior change .
because we know .
it &apos;s being lost .
and there was a day about seven years ago : I was planting potatoes , it was the first week of May -- this is New England , when the apple trees are just vibrating with bloom ; they &apos;re just white clouds above .
and I realized that in the same way you can look at a flower and deduce all sorts of interesting things about the taste and the desires of bees -- that they like sweetness , that they like this color and not that color , that they like symmetry -- what could we find out about ourselves by doing the same thing ?
we are still Car@@ te@@ sians -- the children of Descartes -- who believe that subjec@@ tivity , consciousness , sets us apart ; that the world is divided into subjects and objects ; that there is nature on one side , culture on another .
and what they &apos;re doing is very interesting : they &apos;re digging through the cow pat@@ ties for the maggots , the grubs , the larvae of flies .
there are a lot of farmers doing this today .
this is what one second looks like .
anyway , you can all enjoy it for yourselves -- hopefully that search will work .
and in News &apos; case , you know , they had a couple of people working on it for a while , and then more and more people started using it , and then we put it out on the Internet , and more and more people started using it .
but if you go to our site and search for &quot; Des@@ k@@ bar , &quot; you &apos;ll get this .
and our algorithms -- not a person , of course , but our algorithms , our computers -- read his blog and decided that the related search was , &quot; I am bored . &quot;
so with that , maybe I can switch back to the world .
and you see someone at C@@ V@@ S or -- not C@@ V@@ S -- at Christian Di@@ or or something , and then ...
and that &apos;s very powerful to me . status is really good motivator .
the third one I want to talk about quickly is the progression dynamic , where you have to sort of make progress , you have to move through different steps in a very granular fashion .
let &apos;s all build it together , let &apos;s do it well and have fun playing .
and as a kid I grew up very close to here , and one of my favorite things to do was to cycle along by the side of the railway waiting for the great big express trains to ro@@ ar past .
and in these times of change , we need these new choices because our existing solutions are simply becoming obsolete .
first assumption : if a choice affects you , then you should be the one to make it .
it is essential for success .
the first-@@ generation children were strongly influenced by their immigrant parents &apos; approach to choice .
you will surely find the perfect match .
when the participants arrived for their interview , I offered them a set of drinks : Coke , Diet Coke , Spr@@ ite -- seven , to be exact .
they were flooded with choice before they could protest that they didn &apos;t know how to swim .
and so I asked them , &quot; Well , how do I tell them apart ?
BG : thank you . Sheena I@@ yengar . thank you Sheena .
so I brought to you for the first time on the TED stage Protei Number E@@ ight . it &apos;s not the last one , but it &apos;s a good one for making demos .
now , if you &apos;re taking the same system , and you &apos;re putting vertical , you &apos;re bending , and if you &apos;re moving this way forward , your instinct will tell you that you might go this way , but if you &apos;re moving fast enough , you might create what we call lateral lift , so we could get further or closer to the wind .
it &apos;s to replace competition by collaboration .
girl 1 : well , I think it &apos;s important but , like , not necessary because you can do a lot of other stuff with your free time than watch programs .
journalist : it &apos;s a Whirlwind electronic computer .
if we took Whirlwind and put it in a place that you all know , say , Century City , it would fit beautifully .
but like , let &apos;s imagine we took the latest P@@ enti@@ um processor , the latest C@@ ore 2 Extreme , which is a four-@@ core processor that Intel &apos;s working on , it will be our laptop tomorrow .
there was the Vietnam War . there was black liberation .
narrator : computers , once the unwieldy tools of accountants and other geeks , escaped the back@@ rooms to enter the media frac@@ as .
man : yes , well , first , you know , I &apos;m part of News Corporation as part of Fox Entertainment Group .
and Cuba needs to be far more resourceful , because of the block@@ ades and things , but a really wonderful playground .
now , this is not going to impress you guys who Photoshop , and can do stuff , but this was an actual moment when I got off my bike , and I looked and I thought , it &apos;s as if all of my biker bre@@ thre@@ n had kind of gotten together and con@@ spired to make a little statement .
and it had , once it was in the air , some of this romance that I was in love with .
and I said , &quot; Why ? &quot;
studied painting ; didn &apos;t do very well at that .
so after 25 years I began to feel as though I was running dry .
and so after many trials , many failures , we came up with a very simple arrangement in which we could just move one arm or the other .
they will lay their eggs in clear water , any pool , any puddle , any bird@@ bath , any flower pot , anywhere there &apos;s clear water , they &apos;ll lay their eggs , and if that clear water is near fre@@ ight , it &apos;s near a port , if it &apos;s anywhere near transport , those eggs will then get transported around the world .
the company itself , Ox@@ ite@@ c , we &apos;ve been working for the last 10 years , very much on a sort of similar development pathway that you &apos;d get with a pharmaceutical company .
so fre@@ ight costs aren &apos;t our biggest problem .
&quot; could my doctor have warned me ? &quot;
so with that , I &apos;ll leave you that in my particular view of view of health : geography always matters .
they would not email you back -- but you &apos;d get an automated reply .
now you go back to raising kids and waging peace and craving candy . &quot;
thank you , TED .
the end of the 19th century , beginning of the 20th century , and how that Han@@ ging Cha@@ in model translates into arch@@ ways and vaul@@ ting .
but if the host needs to be mobile in order to transmit the pathogen , then it &apos;s the benign ones that tend to be the winners .
it &apos;s sort of cloudy water .
so , you get this vicious cycle .
just to give you a little perspective on this , I &apos;ve given you a star at the intellectual center of the United States , which is right there in Louisville , Kentucky .
this is important , because it tells us that if you have moderate biting densities , you can eradicate malaria by mosquito proofing houses .
and we take the nerve away from your chest muscle and let these nerves grow into it .
and here we de@@ in@@ nerv@@ ate , or cut the nerve away , just from little segments of muscle and leave others alone that give us our up-@@ down signals and two others that will give us a hand open and close signal .
AK : a little slow , and it was just hard to work .
so Amanda came jet@@ -@@ l@@ ag@@ ged , she &apos;s using the arm , and everything goes wrong .
we took out a whole circuit in the hotel and just about put on the fire alarm .
I mean , they can do like seven kilometers an hour and sustain it .
this is a radio frequency ID system .
as you can see , it &apos;s impossible to read .
the manner in which we mistre@@ at our public spaces is a huge obstacle towards any type of progressive political change because we &apos;ve essentially put a price tag on freedom of expression .
quite the opposite : I actually think people are amazing and smart and that they do care .
okay , so what is the daf-2 receptor telling the inside of the cell ?
and the hormone IGF-1 promotes growth .
that &apos;s how it works . that &apos;s why we don &apos;t see the long lifespan , until we have the daf-2 mutant .
they &apos;re more resistant to these kinds of stresses .
we don &apos;t understand the code used by the brain .
and since I &apos;m realistic , rather than grandiose , I don &apos;t claim that the ability to control the function of the nervous system will at once unravel all its mysteries .
the history of attempts to tinker with the function of the nervous system is long and illustrious .
whenever a flash of light hits the receptor , the pore opens , an electrical current is switched on , and the neuron fires electrical impulses .
you can think of this nagging inner voice as sort of the brain &apos;s equivalent of the Catholic Church , if you &apos;re an Austrian like me , or the super-@@ ego , if you &apos;re Freudian , or your mother , if you &apos;re Jewish .
and now it can go on other surfaces because of the new adhesive that the Stanford group was able to do in designing this incredible robot .
well we know that tails store fat , for example .
but this time what we did is we put a slippery patch that you see in yellow there .
okay , there it goes .
so then we wondered , &quot; Can they actually maneuver with this ? &quot;
but then as it gets closer to the tree , look at the close-up . and see if you can see it land .
and a long time ago -- well , about 40 years ago -- my mom had an exchange student .
and it upset me on a profound level that I wasn &apos;t bothered as much the night before .
man : so with no alibi , Israel will stop ?
it &apos;s about those children who took to the streets , fighting , screaming , &quot; Free Nelson Mandela ! &quot;
and there are incredible organizations that are out there doing this already .
he proposed that our universe might actually have more than the three dimensions that we are all aware of .
the idea goes like this : imagine space is a substrate of all there is .
in the remaining time , I &apos;d like to tell you two features of them .
this is what string theory says about the extra dimensions .
Rob Dunbar hun@@ ts for data on our climate from 12,000 years ago , finding clues inside ancient seab@@ eds and corals and inside ice sheets . his work is vital in setting bas@@ elines for fixing our current climate -- and in tracking the rise of deadly ocean acidification .
and by this weird quir@@ k of alpha@@ be@@ tical order of the nations , a lot of the low-lying states , like Kiribati and Na@@ ur@@ u , they were seated at the very end of these immensely long rows .
should it be 450 ? should it be 400 ?
now , Sylvia Earle turned me on to this exact same coral .
but in this case , we measured the different isotopes of oxygen .
it was cooling down until about 1900 or so .
so , all of these things -- greater metabolic demands , reduced reproductive success , changes in respi@@ ration and metabolism .
so in my lab , we of course work on bumblebees .
in politics also , there are different opinions .
and if you think about it , the rabbits that are good at making that trade-off will tend to live and reproduce , and the rabbits that are bad at it will get eaten or starve .
also , feelings that are clou@@ ding the issues -- the cognitive biases I talked about earlier , fears , folk beliefs , basically an inadequate model of reality .
and I want to close with two quick stories to illustrate this .
but it made people feel better .
it &apos;s not just reality ; it &apos;s feeling and reality .
so if you &apos;re going to build a seed bank , you have to decide what you &apos;re going to store in it . right ?
two out of three ate the marshmallow .
they are teaching these kids exactly this principle .
but with the rise of interstate truc@@ king , it was used less and less .
right now , the discussion goes , &quot; Should we talk to the Muslim Bro@@ therhood ?
he &apos;s got a great chapter about it .
you would not believe it !
and you may be familiar with the movie &quot; Con@@ t@@ act , &quot; which sort of popularized that .
I &apos;m going to read a few strips .
the click is the modern trium@@ pha@@ l clari@@ on proce@@ eding us through life , announcing our entry into every light@@ less room .
but wouldn &apos;t it be an easy matter to wire a wall switch so that it triggers the mu@@ ted horn of a steam ship ?
ap@@ ric@@ ot halves like the ears of cher@@ ubi@@ m .
in fact , the date -- I &apos;m curious to know if any of you know what happened on this momentous date ?
now what is a tribe ? a tribe is a group of about 20 -- so kind of more than a team -- 20 to about 150 people .
they always have . they always will .
now , my birthday is coming up shortly , and my driver &apos;s license ex@@ pires .
so , people hear this and they conclude the following , as did we in doing the study .
we &apos;re great ! who is not great ? England ! &quot;
but we &apos;re not done yet . because then how do we go from Stage Four , which is great , to Stage Five ?
you know they do polls , right ?
so if I can make an analogy , let &apos;s say that you were trying to tell the difference between a good restaurant , a healthy restaurant and a sick restaurant , and all you had was the list of ingredients that they had in their lar@@ der .
so we &apos;re actually measuring each isot@@ ope as a different one .
it &apos;s you ; you &apos;re broken .
and so what I &apos;d like to do this morning for the next few minutes is perform a linguistic resurrection .
he liked to talk about the spiritual geniuses of the ages .
and they feature as their role models really great salesmen .
and I said , that I got to write it .
a lot of people say , &quot; I &apos;m living . &quot; no , you &apos;re not living -- that &apos;s just existing .
I think it comes down to this issue of : why am I here ? what am I here for ? where am I going ?
basically , he &apos;s talking about all the marginalized in society .
and I asked them , I said , &quot; What &apos;s in your hand ?
it &apos;s about making the world a better place . &quot;
and , as you can imagine , if you can picture this : I was born in a very small village in Mexico , in , unfortunately , very poor surroundings , and my parents did not have a college education .
we &apos;re talking about something very similar here .
and the last piece , which is really important -- and this is an opinion that we have , not shared by many , this is one where we seem to stand alone , on this one -- is that we really believe that the greatest success of this initiative can come by fostering local , integrated , end-@@ to-@@ end ecosystems .
and to be able to meet the needs of this rather complex educational system , it could only be done from inside .
the engineers have done a phenomenal amount of innovation on this part , and battery life on this product is now 15 hours -- just through a lot of innovative work people have done because they &apos;re passionate and motivated to be able to do this .
last year , we ran a &quot; Give One , Get One &quot; program , and it generated over 100,000 laptops that we were then able to give free .
there &apos;s actually a gentleman in the front row who &apos;s doing a perfect imitation of her look .
you &apos;re sitting there in class , and your teacher is handing back quiz papers , and one of them looks like this .
here &apos;s your brute force approach . once you get through your brute force approach , then you just rip off whole moun@@ ta@@ int@@ ops . and you end up with the single largest source of carbon emissions , which are coal-fired gas plants . that is probably not the best use of bioenergy .
and that &apos;s what I did a few years ago when I took that five-@@ level hierarchy of needs pyramid and turned it into what I call the transformation pyramid , which is survival , success and transformation .
he said the following , he said : &quot; why are we so obsessed and focused with gross domestic product ?
or in other words , I think the Bhutanese believe happiness equals wanting what you have -- imagine gratitude -- divided by having what you want -- gratification .
I was also a curious economics major as an undergrad .
BL : and sometimes , when things don &apos;t go our way , we get a little bit annoyed , right ?
so we asked Larry and Natalie Hem@@ pel to write a commentary situ@@ ating the findings for scientists , right , putting in the references , and we submit it to Biology Letters .
thank you . BL : thank you very much .
we don &apos;t have disposable species .
and the way that we get there is to first of all recognize that the idea of disposability not only hurts the species we &apos;ve talked about , but it even corrupts our own society .
at the end of my first year in school , in the summer of that year , I discovered a couple humming@@ birds that were caught in a shed near my home .
and it &apos;s been a great motivator .
redundancy is the critical issue here .
I characterized this emerging technology in an aphor@@ ism , as it &apos;s described , which really talks about what I &apos;ve experienced , and I &apos;m sure what other people may have experienced in emerging technologies .
imagine if you can get rid of it .
so , I wanted to show you something .
as the mushrooms grow , I pick the best feed@@ ers to become Infinity Mush@@ rooms .
so the Virtual Earth initiative , and other types of these initiatives , are all about extending our current search metaphor .
the poor PC guy . they &apos;re duct taping his head . they &apos;re just wrapping it on him .
but over the last 30 years , China undoubtedly has done much better than India .
in an interview printed in the financial press of India , He said that he wants to make Mumbai another Shanghai .
and Country 2 is China .
in developing countries , the most common mode of transportation is the railways , and the British built a lot of railways in India .
by 2008 , Country A has surpassed Country B with $ 700 per capita GDP as compared with $ 650 per capita GDP .
it shows the systematic discrimination and biases in the Indian society against women .
they seem to have the expertise to keep cars working .
and so that &apos;s the project that I pursued for that year , and it &apos;s continuing now as well , and found that a specific pur@@ ine derivative called &quot; gu@@ an@@ id@@ ine &quot; had inhibited the cell growth by approximately 60 percent .
at first when I heard of cancer stem cells , I didn &apos;t really know how to put the two together . I &apos;d heard of stem cells , and I &apos;d heard of them as the pan@@ ace@@ a of the future -- the therapy of many diseases to come in the future , perhaps .
and while I was doing this , I was reading the cancer literature , trying to -- again -- familiar@@ ize myself with this new medical field .
I used to be a photographer for many years .
and I went off on assignment and came back a week later , and Father Keene said , &quot; I &apos;ve got to talk to you about Hyun-Sook . &quot;
this was movie day -- that she organized -- where all the kids went to the movies .
here I &apos;ve been , playing God with my friends &apos; lives , my friends &apos; son , with Natasha &apos;s life , and this what you get when you try playing God , is you hurt people .
eleven people ended up dying in the fire .
it was like the ultimate per@@ k .
unfortunately , as you can see , there was a very different picture .
most of these are candidates .
and that potential , that powerful potential , is also our potential , of you and me .
Hans Rosling on HIV : new facts and stunning data visuals
here it goes .
and six , the work ethic .
you can play a game and try and think of one I &apos;ve missed at , or try and boil it down to just four , but you &apos;ll lose .
silks could be incorporated into body and equipment armor that would be more lightweight and flexible than any armor available today .
we &apos;ve gone from people with photos to photographers .
that sounds strange because we expect average and middle to be about the same , but they &apos;re not at all .
but when you &apos;re down here , where the Psycho Mil@@ ts of the world are adding one photo at a time , that &apos;s institution as obstacle .
Steve Ball@@ mer , now CEO of Microsoft , was criticizing Linux a couple of years ago , and he said , &quot; Oh , this business of thousands of programmers contributing to Linux , this is a myth .
but when they get hydr@@ ated and they bond to each other , they create a stronger molecule , a stronger protein we call gluten .
and so we , in the mixing process , have to develop the gluten , we have to activate the leaven or the yeast , and we have to essentially distribute all the ingredients evenly .
so now we not only have a high-@@ fiber bread , but now fiber on top of fiber .
and I &apos;m not kidding , I just think we should just say that and move forward .
that would be the kind of thing that I would do , and it &apos;s not necessarily better than the Beethoven .
they &apos;re all mounted on my instruments .
I &apos;m glad I &apos;m past that . we &apos;re not going to go into that .
okay , I hear you were laughing nervously because you too could hear that the drill was a little bit sharp , the int@@ on@@ ation was a little questionable .
&quot; babies and young children are like the R &amp; D division of the human species , &quot; says psychologist Alison G@@ op@@ nik . her research explores the sophisticated intelli@@ gen@@ ce-@@ gathering and decision-making that babies are really doing when they play .
the reason for that is that these characters are actually not real characters .
and for that , we use the neural network , which we based on that part of the nervous system that we have in our spine that controls walking in humans .
those are then selected by the algorithm , reproduced with mutation and re@@ combinations to introduce sex as well .
at the moment , you only have empty computer graphics in games .
you feel kind of sorry for that thing , and we &apos;ve seen it so many times now that we don &apos;t really care any more .
and let &apos;s just have a look at a slightly different visualization .
you can run this simulation in real time , in front of your eyes , change it , if you want to , and you get the animation straight out of it .
and , I think , we &apos;re only there if we can have something like ballet dancing .
so this is about pot@@ ty training -- as most of you , I hope , know .
blood comes gu@@ shing from your ga@@ shes . with your fading strength , you call 9-@@ 1-@@ 1 and you pray for a trained MD . but you get me .
so individuals in small groups super-@@ empowered by access to these kinds of self-replicating technologies , whether it be biological or other , are clearly a danger in our world .
and we really don &apos;t have experience with pandemics , and we &apos;re also not very good as a society at acting to things we don &apos;t have direct and sort of gu@@ t-@@ level experience with .
but I wanted to share with you three areas that I &apos;m particularly excited about and that relate to the problems that I was talking about in the Wired article .
and we &apos;ve dedicated -- we &apos;ve just raised a new fund , we dedicated 100 million dollars to these kinds of investments .
I became increasingly , kind of voyeur@@ istically interested in the question of you know , why do people spend these crazy amounts of money , not only on wine but on lots of things , and are they living a better life than me ?
this is Tom Cru@@ ise arriving at the &quot; Mission : impossible III &quot; premiere .
so the Mars Rovers didn &apos;t scoop up any alien life@@ forms . scientist Penelope Boston thinks there &apos;s a good chance -- a 25 to 50 percent chance , in fact -- that life might exist on Mars , deep inside the planet &apos;s caves . she details how we should look and why .
many of them are trying to kill us from the minute we go into them , but nevertheless , they &apos;re absolutely gripping , and contain unbelievable biological wonders that are very , very different from those that we have on the planet .
I &apos;m very passionately interested in the human future , on the Moon and Mars particularly , and elsewhere in the solar system .
why don &apos;t I have a normal job , a sensible job ?
there is tremendous amounts of hydrogen sulfide coming into this cave from volcanic sources and from the breakdown of evapor@@ ite -- minerals below the carbon@@ ates in which this cave is formed -- and it is a completely hostile environment for us .
in this cave , great areas are covered by this red@@ dish material that you see here , and also these enormous crystals of sel@@ en@@ ite that you can see dangling down .
on the left you can see a lava tube forming at a recent eruption -- Mount Et@@ na in S@@ ici@@ ly -- and this is the way these tubes form .
why would we want to do it robotically ?
but if you do need to talk about something , you can state it in a way that gives you no satisfaction , such as , &quot; I really want to run this marathon , so I need to train five times a week and kick my ass if I don &apos;t , okay ? &quot;
and I think by aligning international advocates that are addressing hunger and domestic advocates that are addressing obesity , we might actually look for long-term solutions that will make the food system better for everyone .
and I think the most interesting way to think about how all this is going on is in terms of rewards .
this is a bit like ambition and drive -- I &apos;m going to do that . I &apos;m going to work hard .
and each of these rewards is carefully calibrated to the item .
but now , we can reverse engineer that and build worlds that expres@@ sly tick our evolutionary boxes .
second , multiple long and short-term aims -- 5,000 pies , boring , 15 pies , interesting .
now the staggering system , not just that this worked in Ever@@ Quest , but that today , a decade on , every single video game in the world with this kind of task uses a version of this system -- tens of millions of people .
and that suddenly , people , en masse , were leaving scores and scores of digital footprints online that told stories of their private lives .
and any of these can be opened up to reveal the sentence inside .
&quot; I feel skinny , but I &apos;m not . &quot;
and we could do something as arbitrary as , say , extract the story of R@@ ony , involving the concepts of blood and whales and tools , taking place on the Arctic Ocean , at Ah@@ ki@@ v@@ ga@@ q camp , with the heartbeat level of fast .
it &apos;s baleen . moving on .
he had this amazing series of hairs growing out of a mo@@ le on the left side of his face , which I &apos;m told is very good luck .
JH : so if you caught that , she said she hoped to die when she was around 40 . that was enough life for her .
meaning : the artistic director doesn &apos;t necessarily need to go through our lobby .
and to remind you that here is an example in which architecture actually did something .
and here you simply burn it .
the wax printer does what looks like printing .
I don &apos;t know whether the idea of one computer , one child makes any sense . here &apos;s the computer of the future , because this screen is already there and they &apos;re ubiquitous .
we faced Rwanda ; we faced Bosnia , and then we re@@ discovered our confidence .
so , as the president now reas@@ su@@ res us , we are on track to achieve our goals .
because this isn &apos;t the 1990s anymore .
but 18 months later , I asked him why he had tried to shoot me .
it &apos;s not ; it &apos;s a wonderful place full of incredible energy and intelligence .
now is this a new idea ?
this has been done by an incredible , princi@@ pled effort by the international community , and , of course , above all , by Bos@@ ni@@ ans themselves .
we set up a no-@@ fly zone within 48 hours because G@@ ad@@ daf@@ i had no planes within 48 hours .
once more , humility , limits , honesty , realistic expectations and we could have achieved something to be proud of .
the other variable that &apos;s important is the type of neighborhood that you live in .
a few months ago , a 40 year-old woman came to an emergency room in a hospital close to where I live , and she was brought in confused .
within a few minutes , she went into cardiac collapse .
and it &apos;s interesting that Fildes picked this topic .
they had her scanned inside out .
and I remember my very first patient in that series continued to tell me more history during what was meant to be the physical exam visit .
and if you short@@ change that ritual by not un@@ dressing the patient , by listening with your stethoscope on top of the nightgown , by not doing a complete exam , you have bypassed on the opportunity to seal the patient-@@ physician relationship .
but let &apos;s face it -- there &apos;s a lot of bunk , and we are like the bun@@ ko squ@@ ads of the police departments out there , flushing out .
and that &apos;s probably the key lesson to my short talk here , is that this is how psychics work , astro@@ log@@ ers , and tar@@ ot card readers and so on .
that what we do for a living now , all of us , I think , is find something worth changing , and then assemble tribes that assemble tribes that spread the idea and spread the idea .
give me comfort , give me edge .
it &apos;s around the same time , I think it was built around 17@@ 76 .
many comment@@ ators have said that death is the forbidden subject of our generation .
and he said , &quot; Spe@@ aking for myself , I can only say that the grandeur of the cosmos serves only to confirm a belief in the certainty of a creator . &quot;
human contracted itself blind , malignant .
harvest contaminated tobacco .
but here we are , 20 years on , and the greatest change in how we relate to computers is the iPad , not HAL .
it &apos;s a sexy vision , for sure . many have embraced it .
again , we start by designing the human into the process .
January and February are the dry months in Haiti , yet many of the camps had developed standing water .
what I thought I would do is I would start with a simple request .
not a very useful skill , especially when the money runs out .
and the reality of the society that we &apos;re in is there are thousands and thousands of people out there leading lives of quiet , screaming desperation , where they work long , hard hours at jobs they hate to enable them to buy things they don &apos;t need to impress people they don &apos;t like .
before I went back to work after my year at home , I sat down and I wrote out a detailed , step-by-step description of the ideal balanced day that I aspi@@ red to .
we also built the city &apos;s -- New York City &apos;s first green and cool roof demonstration project on top of our offices .
help me fight for environmental and economic justice .
at that time there was a &quot; we &quot; and &quot; them . &quot;
there &apos;s a discrepancy in what &apos;s happening today in the emerging economies .
and this is really what has to be changed .
and it &apos;s fair to say that in these 10 years , we &apos;ve witnessed absolutely the start of a scientific revolution -- that of genome medicine .
it &apos;s been known for decades what causes this malign@@ ancy .
and he obliged us .
and you can see this PET scan of a mouse -- what we call a pet PET .
and everyone in the lab , especially following the interaction with these patients , feels quite compelled to deliver a drug substance based on this molecule .
the universe is really big .
Boltzmann gave us a formula -- engraved on his tom@@ b@@ stone now -- that really quanti@@ fies what entropy is .
it &apos;s not something you have to worry about -- the air in this room all gathering over one part of the room and suffoc@@ ating us .
but if you &apos;re Boltzmann , you know that if you wait long enough , the random fluctuations of those molecules will occasionally bring them into lower entropy configurations .
even if you left our galaxy out , you would not get a hundred billion other galaxies .
and Feynman also understood this .
here is the universe that we tell you about , versus the universe that really exists .
so here &apos;s two questions for you .
that &apos;s because an egg is not a closed system ; it comes out of a chicken .
two years ago , I stood on the TED stage in A@@ rusha , Tanzania .
I could not get rid of them .
and it will actually help us not end up being machines sitting in front of other machines .
Pranav Mistry : so , there are lots of companies -- actually sponsor companies of Media Lab -- interested in taking this ahead in one or another way .
the peacock &apos;s magnificent tail is the most famous example of this .
hand axes mark an evolutionary advance in human history -- tools fashioned to function as what Darwin@@ ians call &quot; fitness signals &quot; -- that is to say , displays that are performances like the peacock &apos;s tail , except that , unlike hair and feathers , the hand axes are consciously cleverly crafted .
the material was generated in two years of work I did for the Secretary of Defense , thinking about a new national grand strategy for the United States .
here &apos;s my parody and it ain &apos;t much of one .
we asked the Russians for 40,000 .
bad Pentagon , bad ! &quot;
going back to the beginning of our country -- historically , defenses meant protection of the homeland .
a Department of War , a Department of Everything Else .
a big stick , a baton stick .
we connected national security to international security with about a seven minute time delay .
you break out that Leviathan Force , you promise , you guarantee that you &apos;re going to mount one hell of a -- immediately -- fol@@ low-@@ on Sys Admin effort .
international organizations , non-governmental organizations , private voluntary organizations , contractors .
this is about being up front with these guys and g@@ als .
this is the sensory data , and that data is transferred to the devices through the computer .
so basically that &apos;s how it works .
and my mom took these pictures actually , last week , of our carpets , and I remember this to this day .
and then there was another influence .
those are pretty good escap@@ es from the dra@@ b weather in Switzerland .
and what I wanted to work on is important stuff .
and then , of course , design is never done .
this is the One Laptop per Child , the $ 100 laptop .
it &apos;s actually just launched , actually launched on Valentine &apos;s Day , February 14 , about 10 days ago .
there stand some interesting places a little further out : the moons of Jupiter and Saturn .
it &apos;s quite likely that it would move out of the ocean onto the surface , just as it did on the Earth .
we &apos;re having great difficulties at the moment and any creatures that live on a planet are pretty well stuck .
I &apos;m inde@@ b@@ ted to them , as I am to my parents , who for some set of mis@@ demean@@ ors in their last life , were blessed with three daughters in this one .
and I smile , and I nod , realizing I &apos;m watching women and girls using their own religious traditions and practices , turning them into instruments of opposition and opportunity .
we were not going to leave until the peace accord was signed . &quot;
women like Sakena and Le@@ ah and Layma have humbled me and changed me and made me realize that I should not be so quick to jump to assumptions of any kind .
we can wear a sari or a hijab or pants or a bou@@ b@@ ou , and we can be party leaders and presidents and human rights lawyers .
and she is definitely on her way .
well , ultimately , it could mean that you could print your own medicine .
and if you wonder why this is interesting at all , you have to see the rest of Saudi Arabia because it &apos;s a country which is strictly divided between the sexes .
and I think the West , at least some powers in the West , particularly the United States , made the mistake of supporting those secular dictators , thinking that they were more helpful for their interests .
and the dragons that arose are still among us today .
Jurassic Park still sh@@ im@@ mers in part of Madagascar , and the center of Brazil , where plants called &quot; cy@@ ca@@ ds &quot; remain rock hard .
fl@@ amin@@ gos covered continents . migrations got underway .
three things stand out : leadership , diplomacy and institutional design .
and in Iraq , finally , violence is on the rise again , and the country has yet to form a government four months after its last parliamentary elections .
crucially , for the long-term success of the peace process in Northern Ireland , he imposed very clear conditions for the participation and negotiations .
subsequent re@@ visions of the agreement were facilitated by the British and Irish governments , who never wa@@ vered in their determination to bring peace and stability to Northern Ireland .
rather , local leaders committed to re@@ visiting them later on .
the comprehensive peace agreement for Sudan signed in 2005 turned out to be less comprehensive than envi@@ sa@@ ged , and its provisions may yet bear the seeds of a full-scale return to war between north and south .
and third , a lack of imagination when it came to designing institutions that could have addressed the concerns of Ser@@ bs and Alban@@ ians alike .
we wanted to share our stories with each other .
and at that young age , 10 years old , Benki became the pa@@ je of his community .
Benki came back to his village full of ideas -- new technologies , new research , new ways of understanding what was going on .
why are you putting yourself at risk ?
he has nine other buildings -- that are already open to the public -- filled to the ra@@ f@@ ters with artifacts documenting contemporary Chinese history .
when Krishna dies , eventually he will be back as Ram .
you go again and again and again .
sounds very much like the journey through the wilderness to the promised land , with the commandments held by the leader .
but in India there is no &quot; the &quot; promised land .
and I worked in the healthcare industry .
which is really ingenious , because we all know that T-Mobile is the most pathetic carrier .
J@@ P : no not at all . I &apos;m having a great day with the kids .
now you get it .
excuse me one second .
so this is Grand Central at work -- it &apos;s a -- oh , for gods sake !
I actually got a photograph of the Verizon employee right there .
well anyway -- oh ! here we go !
so now I &apos;m going to tell you how to get out of that .
phone : Hey you , what &apos;s going on ?
phone : Hey , this is Mr. Johnson calling from the office .
&quot; we had wireless base stations that could broadcast -- yay , about 150 feet across . &quot;
this is the translator program . they have every language in the world .
anyway , just amazing , amazing things .
touch screen -- very , very nice .
sorry , that was mean .
she and I were both very pregnant at that time , and my heart just ached for her , imagining how afraid she must be .
where there is this much legal smoke , there is likely to be some fire .
well , you need to read the details of your mammography report .
the duct tape is gone , and we added a second detector on top of the breast , which has further improved our tumor detection .
we took irregular dosage .
so I wanted to create a new kind of medicine , in order to create a new kind of relationship between the patient and the treatment .
so the first day , this is the big one .
and when the kids wake up , he can see the object needs him . and he take him to his mouth , and breathe the air it contains .
so the idea of this object is to be able to get at home very local food .
I can look at your clicking patterns .
take a number , any number -- two .
but maybe you don &apos;t feel that way either .
we care what happens in &quot; A@@ po@@ cal@@ yp@@ se Now . &quot;
you couldn &apos;t really do petty crime , either .
and it was a perfect drug . you could sell for -- buy the cocaine that went into it for a dollar , sell it for five dollars .
they get the name of the gang behind them , for merchan@@ dis@@ ing and marketing .
it was below the minimum wage , OK ? and this is well documented .
that &apos;s extremely high .
but then we asked the gang member , &quot; Well , why is it you always get paid , and your workers don &apos;t always get paid ? &quot;
we &apos;re still working on it and we &apos;re developing the wing@@ suits to get better performance , to get more knowledge .
who is the consumer , if you want , and who has responsibility for what one sees ?
and experience is not just a kind of entertainment in a non-@@ casual way .
humankind has been looking for the giant squid since we first started taking pictures underwater . but the elusive deep-sea predator could never be caught on film . Oce@@ an@@ ographer and inventor Edith Widder shares the key insight -- and the teamwork -- that helped to capture the squid on film for the first time .
in 2010 , there was a TED event called Mission Blue held aboard the Lind@@ bla@@ d Explorer in the Galapagos as part of the fulfillment of Sylvia Earle &apos;s TED wish .
we need a NA@@ SA@@ -like organization for ocean exploration , because we need to be exploring and protecting our life support systems here on Earth .
and he said , &quot; Shanghai is the city in the world with most skyscrapers , &quot; but to him it was as if the connection to the roots had been cut over .
China symbolized by the dragon .
it &apos;s actually a stand-up product from Switzerland , because in Switzerland they have a natural need for diagonal elevators .
and we made this small movie that I &apos;d like to show .
it could be a family-@@ size pizza ; it could be a very individu@@ al-@@ size pizza , right ?
and that is what the Copenhagen Con@@ sensus is really trying to do -- to try to put prices on these issues .
but if you want to know which of the two you should deal with first , you can &apos;t ask either of them , because that &apos;s not what they do .
if we invested about 13 billion dollars over the next four years , we could bring that incidence down to half .
and treatment is much , much more expensive than prevention .
basically for the amount of money that we spend , we can do X amount of good in treatment , and 10 times as much good in prevention .
so it doesn &apos;t look like we &apos;re actually on the path of suddenly solving all big problems .
but if we don &apos;t do it , then we can start thinking about where should we start ?
if we worry too much about some things , we end by not worrying about other things .
and it turns out that men and women report very , very similar levels of happiness .
Su@@ z@@ anne Lee : grow your own clothes
BG : okay , so we &apos;ll let you go and save it , and rescue it .
just to make money is not enough meaning in life . &quot;
how much money can I save ?
SO@@ C : I , in my research , have seen that the Taliban have perfected the way in which they recruit and train children , and I think it &apos;s a five-@@ step process .
step four : the older members of the Taliban , the fighters , start talking to the younger boys about the gl@@ ories of martyrdom .
and the basic message is that the Western powers do not care about civilian deaths , so those people who live in areas and support governments that work with Western powers are fair game .
I want you to watch another excerpt from the film .
singer : ♫ On the day of judgment ♫ ♫ My God will call me ♫ ♫ My body will be put back together ♫ ♫ And God will ask me why I did this ♫ SO@@ C : I leave you all with this thought : if you grew up in these circumstances , faced with these choices , would you choose to live in this world or in the glorious afterlife ?
and in fact , as the detail is improving , the quality is improving , the price of the machines are falling and they &apos;re becoming quicker .
so we can run this through to something like prosthetics , which is highly specialized to an individual &apos;s handicap .
you couldn &apos;t really create this or simulate it in any other way .
so I had to give up the first dream , and I focused on the second . &quot;
she would go into the city at night with about 20 girls , look for work , and sometimes come back with a few sh@@ illings , or sometimes with nothing .
but they &apos;re less likely to stick .
my family had moved from Fort Lee , New Jersey to California , and we moved from the snow to lots of heat , and gas lines .
so we tried to look at the Stirling engine in a new way , because it was practical -- weight no longer mattered for our application The internal combustion engine took off because weight mattered because you were moving around .
so when the air pushes up to go from the hot end to the cold end , it puts some heat into the sponge .
it just makes economic sense .
there &apos;s 10,000 watts of light pouring on the stage , one horsepower is 7@@ 56 watts , at full power .
I went to visit Kit@@ ty Car@@ li@@ s@@ le H@@ art , and she is 96 , and when I brought her a copy of &quot; The Ele@@ ments of St@@ yle , &quot; she said she would treasure it .
and one of the molecules I study is called is@@ op@@ rene , which is here . it &apos;s a small organic molecule . you &apos;ve probably never heard of it .
so I want to give a little bit of a different perspective of how we can perhaps look at these things in a little bit of a different way .
at the end of last Christmas only 13 countries had seen H5N1 .
and I would just add we saw the same thing with SARS .
but here I am .
so that &apos;s it . I &apos;m 14 ; I &apos;m becoming a juggler .
nothing to do with golf .
the clubs were escaping me at each throw .
and I was trying constantly to bring them back to me .
now I have all of those ropes parallel like this .
some years ago I was invited to open the Israel Festival by a high-@@ wire walk .
and so we &apos;re trying to disseminate information about the importance of the canopy , the beauty of the canopy , the necessity of intact canop@@ ies , to people outside of academia .
T@@ ree@@ top Barbie is a great example of that .
perhaps Ben Zander and Bill Gates could get together and make an opera about AIDS .
this is the first of two rather extraordinary photographs I &apos;m going to show you today .
we &apos;re all breathing air right now . air is a mixture of oxygen and nitrogen , about 20 percent oxygen . about 80 percent nitrogen is in our lungs .
if you were to go down to a depth of about 130 feet , which is the recommended limit for most scuba divers , you get this pressure effect .
but this is what it looks like , and this kind of habitat just goes on and on and on for miles .
video : look at those ...
and this is my favorite line from the article .
now , we &apos;ve done some back of the envelope calculations , and we &apos;re predicting that there are probably on the order of 2,000 to 2,500 new species in the Indo-@@ Pacific alone .
you have to balance those two goals .
and I &apos;m happy to say that I &apos;m now in the process of setting up this technology here in India .
like many autistic children , his mind was locked inside his body .
it turned out that Justin was almost certainly not autistic .
would the discovery of an older cultural civilization out there inspire us to find ways to survive our increasingly uncertain technological adolescence ?
the second is that problems are soluble .
z@@ ir@@ cons that are mined in the Jack Hills of western Australia , z@@ ir@@ cons taken from the Jack Hills of western Australia tell us that within a few hundred million years of the origin of the planet there was abundant water and perhaps even life .
we misuse language , and talk about the &quot; ascent &quot; of man .
and next month , the Kepler Sp@@ ac@@ ecraft will launch and will begin to tell us just how frequent Earth-like planets are , the targets for SETI &apos;s searches .
so , in the opening days of 2009 , a visionary president stood on the steps of the U.S. Capitol and said , &quot; We cannot help but believe that the old hat@@ re@@ ds shall someday pass , that the lines of tribe shall soon dissolve , that , as the world grows smaller , our common humanity shall reveal itself . &quot;
we were the first film crew in there .
you see , only that way you can be able to understand him .
and one of the worst of these is what it does to our standing in the world if other countries think that everything we do is about oil , if we have to treat countries that have oil differently than countries that don &apos;t have oil .
moreover , three-@@ four@@ ths of the fuel use is caused by the weight of the car .
W@@ AI@@ S Di@@ vide itself though , is a circle of tents in the snow .
imagine juggling a snow@@ ball across the tropics .
this is Mar@@ la Ol@@ m@@ stead who did most of her work when she was three years old .
and here &apos;s a brief clip of this .
she had heard him at the Library of Congress a few weeks before at this extra@@ vag@@ ant black-@@ tie affair .
here are some of the things they say prevents cancer : cru@@ sts , red pepper , lic@@ or@@ ice and coffee .
and I will talk you through all of these and demonstrate how they work , exclusively using examples of people getting stuff wrong .
and the claim was fish oil pills improve school performance and behavior in mainstream children .
and each one of these forces split the world , tore the world apart , divided the world .
China is the world &apos;s greatest anti-@@ poverty program over the last three decades .
suppose that there are two diseases : one of them is rare , the other one is common , but if they are not treated they are equally severe .
the way I like to put this is : one idea . ideas are meant to be shared , so one idea can serve one world , one market .
how many Ram@@ an@@ u@@ j@@ ans are there in India today to@@ iling in the fields , barely able to feed themselves , when they could be feeding the world ?
if you had based your prediction , your forecast on 1900 to 1929 you &apos;d have predicted something like this .
and then I asked myself the question .
if you ask them , they &apos;ll say , &quot; Well , you know the coal , we need the coal .
you can &apos;t expect that . &quot;
we don &apos;t see it that way in the United States , but you see it that way .
these guys standing there , everybody in the photo , I feel this photo , man .
it &apos;s an American , American soldiers , American woman who lost her loved one in the Middle East -- in Iraq or Afghanistan .
they &apos;ve had billions of years to do it , but especially during the earliest period of biological evolution on this planet .
I is for the invasive species like the fire ants , the zebra mus@@ sels , b@@ room grasses and pathogenic bacteria and viruses that are flooding every country , and at an exponential rate -- that &apos;s the I .
I &apos;ve written about this idea before , and I know there are people in this room who have exp@@ ended significant effort on it in the past .
when I was in the third grade , a monumental event happened .
writing is using your imagination on paper , and I do get so scared because I travel to so many schools now and that seems like such a foreign concept to kids , that writing would be using your imagination on paper , if they &apos;re allowed to even write now within the school hours .
he wanted me to go to a private school , and he gave me an option .
and so I took this picture , and I handed it to him .
&quot; you &apos;re really good . you know , the school newspaper needs a new cartoonist , and you should be the cartoonist .
and all the color just dra@@ ined from his face , and he looked at me , and he said , &quot; Forget everything you learned . &quot;
this is a picture of Maur@@ ice D@@ ru@@ on , the Hon@@ or@@ ary Per@@ pe@@ tual Secretary of L &apos;@@ Acade@@ mi@@ e fran@@ ca@@ ise , the French Academy .
and a similar analysis , I think , can apply to the potential awkwardness of a sexual solic@@ itation , and other cases where plausible deni@@ ability is an asset .
and in these years , I met all kinds people like , for instance , farmers and but@@ chers , which seems logical .
are you in anyway related to the Dutch government ? &quot;
so , the most beautiful thing I found -- at least what I think is the most beautiful -- in the book , is this heart valve .
and there &apos;s a lot of cool technologies out there that life has .
back to that shell : the shell is a self-assembling material .
the one on the right is a pill bug -- pulls water out of air , does not drink fresh water .
this is a picture of the spinner@@ ets coming out of a spider and the silk being formed from a spider . isn &apos;t that beautiful ?
and we use all of them , even the toxic ones .
my first business was a dress@@ making business I started under the Taliban .
because -- and I say this as somebody who worked in finance -- 500 billion dollars at least has gone into the emerging markets in the past decade .
because , not only could people broadcast their stories throughout the world , but they could do so using what seemed to be an infinite amount of devices .
now imagine someone as twisted as me trying to build a house .
so that &apos;s no great surprise .
so , it turns out we &apos;ve been finding more and more that crows are really , really intelligent .
then , collect your cracked nut in safety .
and we move to the third stage , where we only give them a coin .
and so this goes on for some time .
that crow enjoys a temporary monopoly on peanuts , until his friends figure out how to do it , and then there we go .
or find expensive components from discarded electronics ?
so this piece is about a negative imagination .
I was so petrified and so numb , all I could look was in the rear-@@ view mirror .
and in the last three years , we &apos;ve been looking specifically at social media to see what has changed , and we &apos;ve discovered some very interesting things .
but my argument is that , if you want to understand the global village , it &apos;s probably a good idea that you figure out what they &apos;re passionate about , what am@@ uses them , what they choose to do in their free time .
because , as I mentioned , the clitoris is inside the vagina .
in his writ@@ e-up , in his writ@@ e-up of this experiment in his book , Kinsey wrote , &quot; Two sheets were laid down to protect the ori@@ ental carpets . &quot;
from all outward appearances , John had everything going for him .
I am fine . after this presentation here at TED , I can simply go back to Switzerland , and you have to go on talking like this all the time .
but to go on , here is a very good example to see .
this is Keith Haring looked at statistically .
now take this together and you end up with 2.3 million words of TEDTalks , which is about three Bi@@ ble@@ s-@@ worth of content .
or happiness : &quot; striving toward happiness = moving toward unhappiness . &quot;
Dimitri : well , you &apos;ve got a new school to go to .
and I promise you , if you &apos;re sitting in front of this screen , that is a truly wonderful moment .
his mind is based in a cloud .
now it &apos;s a little bit of a surprise that to get an answer to that question , we have to go to tool use in the chimpanzees .
this photo was taken two weeks ago .
that report that landed on President Johnson &apos;s desk when I was two years old -- 1965 .
there are a bunch of other versions of it that I and some collaborators have thought about how to exploit .
you might argue about the sanity of it , but the leverage is real .
a very small amount of money would get us some .
so here &apos;s one last thought , which was said much , much better 25 years ago in the U.S. National Academy report than I can say today .
photography threatens fantasy .
they didn &apos;t want to let my camera in because it confron@@ ts constructed realities , myths and beliefs , and provides what appears to be evidence of a truth .
and I found one section amongst all of these that actually resem@@ bled the outline of the United States of America , which you can see here .
and a big part of the work that is sort of absent in this context is text .
and I worked with Me@@ h@@ ta Vi@@ har who creates virtual simulations for the army for tactical practice .
for the men in these photographs , the primary cause of their wrong@@ ful conviction was mistaken identification .
but through exposure to composite sketches , Pol@@ ar@@ oids , mu@@ g shots and lin@@ e-@@ ups , eyewitness testimony can change .
we use this word &quot; happy , &quot; and it &apos;s this very large umbrella of a term .
we have basically at least two systems here , and they both are very ancient .
it goes to the nucleus accum@@ b@@ ens , all the way up to the prefrontal cortex , orbital frontal cortex , where decisions are made , high level .
there , the animal finds a mine .
this is our team in Mozambique : one Tanzanian trainer , who transfers the skills to these three Moz@@ am@@ b@@ ican fellows .
throughout last year , we &apos;ve been -- depending on which intervals you take -- we &apos;ve been consistently increasing case detection rates in five hospitals in D@@ ar es Salaam between 30 and 40 percent .
it &apos;s the greatest mystery confronting human beings : how does this all come about ?
but what R@@ izz@@ ol@@ att@@ i found was a subset of these neurons , maybe about 20 percent of them , will also fire when I &apos;m looking at somebody else performing the same action .
so , how do you do imitation ? why is imitation important ?
but a subset of them will fire even when I watch somebody else being touched in the same location .
and this , of course , is the basis of much of Eastern philosophy , and that is there is no real independent self , alo@@ of from other human beings , inspec@@ ting the world , inspec@@ ting other people .
first of all , pollen is tiny . yes we know that .
so , if you have a pollen sample , then in principle , you should be able to tell where that sample came from .
we &apos;re doing this at the Ced@@ ars-@@ Sinai Heart Institute in the Women &apos;s Heart Center .
and it was just a picto@@ gram to sort of show why more women are dying of heart disease , despite these good treatments that we know and we have work .
these are female and male stem cells .
it &apos;s amazing that these cells beat at all .
let &apos;s remind ourselves that cells are not an abstract concept .
and so fundamentally , rather than , for example , measuring content based on how many people are watching , this gives us the basic data for looking at engagement properties of content .
so if we go and look at this piece of content , President Obama &apos;s State of the Union address from just a few weeks ago , and look at what we find in this same data set , at the same scale , the engagement properties of this piece of content are truly remarkable .
this is going up into the turret .
I feature ble@@ mish .
Apoll@@ onian mindset creates mountains of waste .
but you know what they did ? they hooked a metaphor into it and said , &quot; I drink Dr. Pep@@ per ... &quot;
I can wipe my mouth on my sleeve , napkin on the table , chew with my mouth open , make little noises , scratch wherever I want .
everybody points and laughs , and they say , &quot; He tried it a fifth time and it still didn &apos;t work .
and your instinct is to say , &quot; Why don &apos;t you suck an egg ? &quot;
we &apos;re in trouble .
and if we look where the income ends up -- the income -- this is 100 percent the world &apos;s annual income . and the richest 20 percent , they take out of that about 74 percent . and the poorest 20 percent , they take about two percent . and this shows that the concept of developing countries is extremely doub@@ tful . we think about aid , like these people here giving aid to these people here . but in the middle , we have most the world population , and they have now 24 percent of the income .
I can split South Asia here . India &apos;s the big bubble in the middle .
because the data is hidden down in the databases .
and this won &apos;t work . so what is needed ? we have the databases .
Nobel laureate James Watson opens TED@@ 2005 with the frank and funny story of how he and his research partner , Francis Crick , discovered the structure of DNA .
and boy , I was scared because I thought , you know , we may be scooped .
so the DNA is really badly muc@@ ked up , whereas if you have a chance of surviving , the DNA isn &apos;t so muc@@ ked up .
we haven &apos;t yet looked at the parents , but the parents probably don &apos;t have that loss , or they wouldn &apos;t be parents .
and that comes down right way to the present with the dollar bill in the United States , which has on it an eye of provi@@ dence .
this is how I was when I returned from the hospital after nearly four months .
that was a fair question because my memoir was simply how I found solutions that worked for me .
up to 30 percent of the population have a disorder , disease or dysfunction in the jaw that affects the entire body .
the audience is too small .
now this is a tactic that patent trolls are supposed to use on people to get their way .
my solution : award me this patent and I will troll them out of existence .
&quot; I haven &apos;t heard from my dad in years . &quot;
so what we &apos;re looking for is a permanent solution .
now we don &apos;t have a great track record when it comes to doing something like this , to eradicating diseases .
it &apos;s also tried to save children by doing other things -- giving vitamin A drops , giving meas@@ les shots , giving bed nets against malaria even during some of these campaigns .
these are children like Umar .
and this started an incredible collaboration with industry , and within six months , we were testing a new polio vaccine that targeted , just two years ago , the last two types of polio in the world .
Dereck J@@ oubert : well , our lives have basically been like a super long episode of &quot; CSI &quot; -- something like 28 years .
this particular one is called E@@ e@@ tw@@ id@@ om@@ ay@@ loh , &quot; he who greets with fire , &quot; and you can just see that about him , you know -- that &apos;s his character .
but that &apos;s , I think , what this is all about , is that these individuals have these personalities and characters .
we &apos;re on the edge through a large part of the time .
and over the next five hours , she took care of it .
DJ : so at this stage , I guess , we had very , very firm ideas on what conservation meant .
because there &apos;s a sport , there &apos;s an activity going on that we &apos;re all aware of , that we con@@ done .
what is it that makes us capable of sup@@ posing anything , and does this tell us anything about what we can suppose ?
&quot; tell me , &quot; he asked a friend , &quot; why do people always say , it was natural for man to assume that the sun went round the earth rather than that the earth was rotating ? &quot;
I have every reason to think it &apos;s true ; I was reading Play@@ boy because I , myself , had an article in it .
what we can see here is the metal sheet , this time connected to a sound driver and being fed by a frequency generator .
and here is a starfish and a cymatic starfish .
and we can evolve this exploration of the substance of things not seen . thank you .
it puts a human face on issues which , from afar , can appear abstract or ideological or monumental in their global impact .
my TED wish . there &apos;s a vital story that needs to be told and I wish for TED to help me gain access to it and then to help me come up with innovative and exciting ways to use news photography in the digital era .
because what happens on a social network is you interact with the people that you have chosen to interact with .
they believe that 24 percent of American Twitter users are African-American .
even within Wiki@@ pedias , where we &apos;re creating their own content online , there &apos;s a heavy bias towards the place where a lot of the Wikipedia authors are based , rather than to the rest of the world .
so a very , very small program designed to get people in front of computers , publishing their own thoughts , publishing independent media , ended up having a huge impact on what we know about this country .
but if what you &apos;re looking for is serendipity , if you want to stumble onto something that you didn &apos;t know you needed , our main philosophy is to look to our social networks , to look for our friends .
and so people begin thinking in terms of electricity to produce convulsions .
and patients &apos; rights groups seemed to get very upset about the kinds of things that they would witness .
as my refer@@ r@@ als began to decrease , I clearly became increasingly depressed until I thought , my God , I can &apos;t work anymore .
and you know , of course , what &apos;ll happen if you do a pre-frontal lobotomy .
reporter Jennifer 8 . Lee talks about her hunt for the origins of familiar Chin@@ ese-@@ American dishes -- exploring the hidden spots where these two cultures have combined to form a new cuisine .
the original name in my book was actually called The Long March of General Tso , and he has marched very far indeed , because he is sweet , he is fried , and he is chicken -- all things that Americans love .
it was introduced into the United States in the 1800s , but became popularized in the 1920s and the 1930s .
so , this actually became very clear to me with the March 30 , 2005 Power@@ ball drawing , where , you know , they expected , based on the number of ticket sales they had , to have three or four second-@@ place winners -- those are the people who match five or six Power@@ ball numbers .
Fi@@ or@@ enzo O@@ men@@ et@@ to : silk , the ancient material of the future
so you have a clock , you have protein , and now a silk cup like this can be thrown away without guilt -- unlike the poly@@ sty@@ rene cups that unfortunately fill our landfills everyday .
I &apos;m also interested in creating new technologies for the arts and to attract people to science and technology .
ready for some jokes ?
and , of course , he never talked about his past life when he was a forger .
then there were the emotional sacrifices : how can one live with a woman while having so many secrets ?
he told me that those false papers were the most medi@@ a-@@ relevant and the least useful he &apos;d had to make in all his life .
the majority of the planet , aspiring for development , having the right for development , are in large aspiring for an unsustainable lifestyle , a momentous pressure .
no scientist could predict that in 2007 , suddenly , what could be crossing a threshold .
under the realization from tourist operators , fishermen , the Australian Great Barrier Reef Authority and scientists that the Great Barrier Reef is doomed under the current governance regime .
everybody talks about carbon taxes -- it won &apos;t work -- emission schemes , but for example , one policy measure , feed@@ -in tari@@ ffs on the energy system , which is already applied , from China doing it on offshore wind systems , all the way to the U.S .
the Bon@@ sai table .
and I wanted to deal with other subjects .
I started taking that into the realm of landscape , which is something that &apos;s almost a picture of nothing .
and with absolute difference -- and I mean a difference where people inside Africa at a certain position , where all individuals -- 100 percent -- have one letter , and everybody outside Africa has another letter .
and I &apos;d look around , and then I &apos;d see another par@@ atro@@ oper , a young guy or girl , and they &apos;d have pulled out their M@@ 4 carb@@ ine and they &apos;d be picking up their equipment .
and he said , &quot; Sir , he &apos;s fine . thanks for asking . &quot;
the brilliant playwright , Adri@@ enne Kennedy , wrote a volume called &quot; People Who L@@ ed to My Pla@@ ys . &quot;
it &apos;s considering what it means for these artists to be both out in the world as their work travels , but in their communities as people who are seeing and thinking about the issues that face us .
the future that we will create can be a future that we &apos;ll be proud of .
now , there &apos;s an enormous variety of tiny , inexpensive sensors on the market , and you can easily imagine someone putting together a phone that could measure temperature , CO2 or methane levels , the presence of some biot@@ ox@@ ins -- potentially , in a few years , maybe even H5N1 avian flu virus .
you could see that some kind of system like this would actually be a really good fit with Larry Brilliant &apos;s In@@ S@@ TED@@ D project .
nobody &apos;s going to fix the world for us , but working together , making use of technological innovations and human communities alike , we might just be able to fix it ourselves .
so when they spoke into it , the computer typed out gib@@ ber@@ ish , so they said , &quot; Well , it doesn &apos;t understand anything of what we are saying . &quot;
so Newcastle gave me a call . I said , &quot; I &apos;ll do it from Delhi . &quot;
I think Andrew pretty well covered that , so I will move to the third point , which is that markets alone also are not going to solve the problems of poverty .
so you put that up front so that , if it fails , at least you know you don &apos;t have to reset the whole thing .
we &apos;re trying to give a future to our past in order to have a future .
the Tasmanian devil got its name from the terrifying no@@ c@@ tur@@ nal scream that it makes .
it evolves .
in fact , more genetic profiling told us that this tumor in Jonas actually probably first arose from the cells of a female Tasmanian devil -- and Jonas was clearly a male .
well the answer is , it has .
he discovered this , a huge bleeding tumor at the base of Kim@@ bo &apos;s penis .
it does increase security .
the United Nations even has an agency which could broker these comp@@ acts ; it &apos;s called the Peace Building Commission .
secondly you need skills , the mundane skills of the construction sector .
on the one hand it pays lip service to the idea of rebuild an effective state in the image of Scandinavia in the 1950s .
clean means follow their money .
so that &apos;s the -- let me wrap up , this is the package .
for example , the great Oxford historian who taught here at this university , A.@@ J.@@ P. Taylor , defined a great power as a country able to prevail in war .
indeed , one of the advantages that the Americans will have in terms of power in Asia is all those countries want an American insurance policy against the rise of China .
it &apos;s as though Mexico and Canada were hostile neighbors to the United States , which they &apos;re not .
and if we have policies in which we take it in that larger historical perspective , we &apos;re going to be able to manage this process .
if you ask how is power distributed in the world today , it &apos;s distributed much like a three-dimensional chess game .
while it &apos;s true that many who died in Katrina did not have access to transportation , others who did refused to leave as the storm approached , often because available transportation and shelters refused to allow them to take their pets .
and I remember the last time I came back from India -- in my long white flowing robes and my big beard and my John Len@@ non glasses -- and I said to my father , &quot; Dad , I think I &apos;ve just about found spiritual enlightenment . &quot;
in this game we had a little girl , and she was the Defense Minister of the poorest nation .
and so we had this situation come up -- last summer actually , at Ag@@ nor@@ -@@ Hur@@ t School in Al@@ be@@ mar@@ le County -- and one of our military commanders got up to read that letter and one of the other kids said , &quot; Mr. Hunter , let &apos;s ask -- there &apos;s a parent over there . &quot;
and there are three seconds left on the clock .
and yet the spider manages to do it at ambient temperature and pressure with raw materials of dead flies and water .
so these two examples give a sense of what biomimicry can deliver .
we &apos;d have a water treatment system treating wastewater , turning that into fresh water and generating energy from the solids using just plants and micro-@@ organisms .
it &apos;s the idea of computation .
so , sometimes , Wolfram Alpha will be able to do the whole thing immediately and just give back a whole big program that you can then compute with .
and , for example , this -- if we go back here -- this has become surprisingly popular among composers finding musical forms by searching the computational universe .
well , my dream of becoming a teacher will not come to pass .
so I talked -- I had to come up with a plan to figure these things out .
so he figured out . &quot; well , &quot; he said , &quot; okay , you &apos;ll go to school after the ceremony . &quot;
it &apos;s a whole week long of excitement .
don &apos;t you have a husband waiting for you ? &quot;
that &apos;s Shar@@ on . that &apos;s five years later .
as a new dawn is happening in my school , a new beginning is happening .
and I want to thank all of you in the audience for being great husbands , great mothers , friends , daughters , sons .
in order to understand this , we &apos;re going to step back and look a little bit at what &apos;s happened over the course of the last year and a half .
commodity prices are like this .
as a result , dé@@ class@@ é consumption is in .
we also talked about character and professionalism .
this is all the opportunity about being a community organizer .
if you &apos;re a woman writer from the Muslim world , like me , then you are expected to write the stories of Muslim women and , preferably , the unhappy stories of unhappy Muslim women .
I never forget my first multicultural reading , in Harvard Square about 10 years ago .
1983 . Bob Dylan is 42 years old , and his time in the cultural spotlight is long since past .
that percentage , by the way , is about the same in the U.S. and Germany and France .
that &apos;s fascinating and beautiful in itself , but we think that the mechanism for powering those fountains requires there to be lakes of liquid water beneath the surface of this moon .
the biggest one was in 1975 by Chase Econ@@ ome@@ trics .
and the electrons can only be in particular places .
and the element helium was discovered just by staring at the light from the Sun because some of those black lines were found that correspon@@ ded to no known element .
well , this is a picture of it .
that &apos;s a Type I@@ a supernova explosion .
and what it does is it sucks gas off its companion star , until it gets to this limit called the Chand@@ ra@@ se@@ khar limit , and then it explodes .
so , now imagine you &apos;re standing on a street , anywhere in Japan , you turn to a person next to you and say , &quot; Ex@@ cuse me , what is the name of this street ? &quot;
you don &apos;t ... ?
and during that time , I actually taught classes without speaking .
I could see they were looking for the schedule , to see when they could get out .
my dad said , &quot; That &apos;s one , &quot; and I still didn &apos;t let that go .
and you know , I forgot the most important thing , which is why I started talking , which I have to tell you .
so I want to thank you for being here and I want to end this in five seconds of silence .
and those two roles came together for me in a book that I wrote called &quot; Ori@@ gin@@ s . &quot;
much of what a pregnant woman encounters in her daily life -- the air she breathes , the food and drink she consumes , the chemicals she &apos;s exposed to , even the emotions she feels -- are shared in some fashion with her fetus .
but audiences don &apos;t come to see the magician die , they come to see him live .
and if the story is a good one , it might even make us smile .
so unless you happened to be a share@@ holder of one or the other organizations or one of the deal@@ makers or lawyers involved in the no-@@ doubt lucrative activity , you &apos;re actually engaging in a huge piece of activity that meant absolutely bug@@ ger-@@ all to anybody , okay ?
has anybody stayed there ?
one of them also being , although logically it &apos;s quite a good idea to have a lift with no up and down button in it , if it only serves two floors , it &apos;s actually bloody terrifying , okay ?
now , interesting that no single person does that , or at least can admit to being so an@@ al as to do it .
that is actually strategy , and I &apos;m not denying that strategy has a role .
so teachers and students all around the world are already using this .
so -- and that &apos;s from less than five months from a prototype in my lab to a major commercial product .
this was the Big Bang , the beginning of the universe .
I was six years old when I first heard stories about the poor .
now I was pretty psyched .
and in general , I got this sort of idea that the poor in the world lived lives that were w@@ rought with suffering and sadness , devastation , hop@@ elessness .
when I heard him speak , it was three years before that .
I don &apos;t think we need to be convinced of that . I think we know ; in fact , I think we know so much , and it &apos;s such a reality that we care so deeply , that in fact , what usually stops us is that we &apos;re afraid to try and to mess up , because we care so very much about helping each other and being meaningful in each other &apos;s lives .
for me , the best way to be inspired to try is to stop and to listen to someone else &apos;s story .
we all have come from a long way , here in Africa , and conver@@ ged in this region of Africa , which is a place where 90 percent of our evolutionary process took place .
first entertainment comes evidence from flutes that are 35,000 years old .
so , for us , paleo@@ anthropologists , our job is to find the hard evidence , the fossil evidence , to fill in this gap and see the different stages of development .
so one of my assistants , who never went to school , said to me , &quot; Listen , Zer@@ ay .
and among the answers that you can get from this skeleton are included : first , this skeleton documents , for the first time , how infants looked over three million years ago .
they don &apos;t preserve well , as you know .
now the question is , we Homo sapiens today are in a position to decide about the future of our planet , possibly more .
here , this guy actually can make himself look like a rock , and , looking at his environment , can actually slide across the bottom , using the waves and the shadows so he can &apos;t be seen .
that is , we &apos;re able to save it from a fate of deep-sea bottom trawling .
I wanted to be an astronaut , so I &apos;ve constantly followed what are the tools available to monitor Earth from outer space -- and that we have incredible tools like we &apos;ve been learning about , in terms of being able to follow tagged species throughout their life-@@ cycles in the open ocean .
what first got me thinking about this was a blog post auth@@ ored earlier this year by Derek K. Miller , who was a science and technology journalist who died of cancer .
it tastes ...
and importantly , it &apos;s a rich source of vitamin B@@ 12 .
he gives half of them vitamin C .
if you wanted to count every product and service on offer in New York -- there are 10 billion of them -- it would take you 3@@ 17 years .
this is how complex the economy we &apos;ve created is .
how do you design that nozzle ?
then we &apos;ll test some other ideas out .
would you like to close down the trial now , or should we wait until we have robust results ? &quot;
and then , here &apos;s how the crash test works .
the car seat &apos;s moving all over the place .
and that &apos;s completely possible . and if that &apos;s the case , then I think we &apos;re stuck with conventional car seats for a long time to come .
I wanted to give you a current picture of the economy .
one is leverage .
and that , of course , is the reason why all of you are making such generous and wonderful donations to these nice folks .
it &apos;s groups like that in this room that generate the future of the U.S. economy .
first they don &apos;t grow .
Twenty-@@ one countries came together . dozens of teams .
she re@@ grew her own trachea , and 72 hours later it was implanted .
the universe was created 13.7 billion years ago , and then you created all the stars , and all the planets , and all the galaxies , and all the Milky Wa@@ ys .
I think we &apos;re going to move from a Homo sapiens into a Homo evol@@ ut@@ is .
the Internet , the Web as we know it , the kind of Web -- the things we &apos;re all talking about -- is already less than 5,000 days old .
the other thing that we know about it was that 10 years ago , as I looked at what even Wired was talking about , we thought it was going to be TV , but better .
and so one of the consequences of that , I believe , is that where we have this sort of spectrum of media right now -- TV , film , video -- that basically becomes one media platform .
so every idea is basically being supported -- or every item , or every noun -- is being supported by the entire Web .
if you allow Google to , it will tell you your search history .
and then , also , was working with broad strategies .
and that the building itself is occupied in the lower portion , broken up by a series of courts , and it &apos;s five acres of uninterrupted , horizontal space for their administrative offices .
and finally , one of the most interesting projects -- it &apos;s a courthouse .
and so the first step is to realize that we can do this together , and that there is no &quot; us &quot; and &quot; them . &quot;
it changed the way our history developed .
count Drac@@ ula teeth in the mouths of your neighbors ?
take something which looks like food , transform it , and it gives you a good , very easy , accessible energy .
I only managed to do it by chewing more co@@ ca leaves in one day than anyone in the 4@@ ,000-@@ year history of the plant .
we were able to , because we had trained people in filmmaking , continue with our work , and send our Wi@@ wa and Ar@@ hu@@ aco filmmakers to the final sacred lakes to get the last shots for the film , and we followed the rest of the Ar@@ hu@@ aco back to the sea , taking the elements from the highlands to the sea .
a people for whom blood on ice is not a sign of death , but an affir@@ mation of life .
today , we use a single feedstock , petroleum , to heat our homes , power our cars and make most of the materials you see around you .
the final step is , of course , the product , whether it &apos;s a packaging material , a table top , or building block .
they &apos;re not going to clog up Earth &apos;s ecosystems . they work great .
it &apos;s worse than silly -- it &apos;s really bad science .
our invention had to address all of these issues .
so we considered all of this . and we realized that electrical appliances must be able to communicate directly with the power receptacle itself .
there are 10 billion electrical outlets in North America alone .
and that &apos;s what I &apos;d like to talk to you a little bit about today .
music is just one of the strangest things that there is .
the sound quality , or the sound of the sound is how I like to describe tim@@ b@@ re , tone color -- they cannot tell these things whatsoever .
now we &apos;ve been doing some studies to really get a sense of what sound quality is like for these implant users .
again , we are very , very far away in just getting to where we want to get to .
what we really want to do in the end is learn how to program self-assembly so that we can build anything , right ?
today I want to tell you why .
where there is no conflict , trade flouri@@ shes .
because she wants a better world .
and a lot of people , when they think about the future , think about it linearly .
you could buy 10 million in 2002 .
there are four major conferences on building blood cell@@ -sized devices ; there are many experiments in animals .
in the 35 years I &apos;ve been a climbing guide and taught on indoor walls , and stuff like that , the most important thing I &apos;ve learned was , guys will always try to do pul@@ l-@@ ups .
and that &apos;s called superstition , and that , I &apos;m afraid , we will always have with us .
our second type of error is a false negative .
L-@@ Dop@@ a increases dopamine .
there &apos;s somebody hiding behind there pulling the strings , whether it &apos;s the Il@@ lumin@@ ati or the Bil@@ der@@ ber@@ gers .
so we can &apos;t just uniformly dismiss all patterns like that .
musician and activist Peter Gabriel shares his very personal motivation for standing up for human rights with the watch@@ dog group WITNESS -- and tells stories of citizen journalists in action .
man : the soldiers with clubs this long beat us to get a confession .
because I need to know that you know that while changing the world is great , it doesn &apos;t always happen .
and you &apos;ve got to get better , and better , and better , and better .
so let &apos;s run through the things you &apos;ve got to include in your presentation .
and I want to know how that business model that you showed me on a product basis is going to translate into a company model .
but then comes the ask .
just your logo on the screen .
you think that I &apos;m looking at that ?
by revolution , I mean a drastic and far-reaching change in the way we think and behave -- the way we think and the way we behave .
so they &apos;re restrictive -- don &apos;t use your mobile phone , don &apos;t use your laptop , don &apos;t search the Internet , don &apos;t be on I.@@ M .
but who do you think with the biggest brains are the biggest players ?
fear is the enemy of play .
I always live in the present -- I love the present .
so I started to say , &quot; Hey , man , you are too much !
that &apos;s Arthur Lei@@ p@@ z@@ ig &apos;s original photograph I loved .
this was about 19@@ 25 .
I started as an apprentice to a Hungarian craftsman , and this taught me what the guil@@ d system was in Middle Ages .
so I dou@@ sed him in co@@ log@@ ne every day , which he thought was very nice , and therefore he brought bread and butter every day , which I had to eat out of cour@@ tes@@ y .
and we feel like some of that difficulty was because of this false advertisement around parenting .
the reason you &apos;re not allowed to chart love is because we think of love as a binary thing .
that continued into the the hospital . it was really exhilarating .
of those , 67 percent are most lonely when their kids are zero to five -- probably really zero to two .
so I &apos;m sitting here looking at the next two decades of my life , this chasm of happiness that we &apos;re driving our proverbial conver@@ tible straight into .
so Liz Mitchell did a wonderful job with this piece , and she interviewed four scientists , and she also interviewed Daniel Gilbert , and we did indeed find a silver lining .
we have violated yet another taboo in our own lives , and this is a bonus taboo .
not being the musicians -- the listeners , right ?
in order to do this , it &apos;s a lot of hardware and software that runs in a very high resolution .
and Gould &apos;s specialty was playing Bach .
that &apos;s the original . &#91; unclear &#93; That &apos;s the two together .
I want to hear the wal@@ t@@ zes Brah@@ ms didn &apos;t write .
and that &apos;s just what the live audience did .
a few of these . this is A@@ til@@ la the hen .
history was over and society would inevitably have to take second place to economy .
it will be worse at the end of this year , quite possibly worse in a year &apos;s time than it is today .
all of this information is oblig@@ atory . Chinese doesn &apos;t let me ignore it .
so many of you know , in this room , that English is a Ger@@ manic language .
and interestingly enough , there are pockets of futureless language speakers situated all over the world .
what you find is nine countries around the world that have significant native populations which speak both futureless and fu@@ tured languages .
at TEDx@@ Dubai , longtime English teacher Patricia Ryan asks a provocative question : is the world &apos;s focus on English preventing the spread of great ideas in other languages ? it &apos;s a passionate defense of translating and sharing ideas .
how did those students get all that knowledge ?
well I don &apos;t know .
and anyway , there was never enough kerosene , because what does a dollar a day buy for you ?
more knowledgeable consumers , more educated , more able to connect with one another , more able to do things together .
and so the debates about copyright , digital rights , so on and so forth -- these are all about trying to stifle , in my view , these kinds of organizations .
and one of the reasons they do that is that they turn users into producers , consumers into designers .
but , being human , he &apos;s immediately thinking of his next complaint .
and you begin to get very sentimental ; you cultivate senti@@ mentality intensely .
that is , you know what simplicity is , you know what complexity is .
they can be on and off . that &apos;s binary .
part of my interest in this , I have to say , is that I would like to -- how do I put this politely ? -- change the way , or maybe evi@@ sc@@ er@@ ate , the capital structure of the U.S. health care system , which I think is fundamentally broken .
and I think that &apos;s a very good way of thinking about the problem .
all the points , all the lines -- it &apos;s incredible .
isn &apos;t it amazing ?
and I figured I &apos;d put it on the Internet for all employees under stress to help you better deal with what you &apos;re going through on your job .
here &apos;s how the song goes .
one stood out in particular .
and this is it , right , to feel and be felt .
what I mean by psychopathic killer are these people , these types of people .
so this is how it &apos;s passed from mother to son .
because my father himself , and my three uncles , in World War II , were all con@@ scienti@@ ous objec@@ tors , all pu@@ s@@ sy@@ cats .
and this is the one that I work on , AT@@ L@@ A@@ S .
you get some sense of the size : 44 meters wide , 22 meters in diameter , 7,000 tons .
then everyone ignores them . they can just pass through the room very quickly , essentially at the speed of light . they &apos;re mass@@ less .
now there &apos;s a theory called super-@@ symmetry , which doubles the number of particles in the standard model , which , at first sight , doesn &apos;t sound like a simplification .
the robot I &apos;m holding in my hand is this one , and it &apos;s been created by two students , Alex and Daniel .
and as you can see , it &apos;s about eight inches in diameter .
multiple flips , a little more time .
so it knows how to combine little bits and pieces of trajectories to do these fairly difficult tasks .
as I will show to you , it is actually the ma@@ inst@@ ay of modern life .
that means that we have now more food available than ever before in human history .
and it frees us all up to do other things -- to sit at TED meetings and not to worry about our food .
the main driver of that is actually meat .
it &apos;s about sharing . it &apos;s about honesty . it &apos;s about identity .
insurance will cover the bypass , it &apos;ll cover the angi@@ op@@ la@@ sty ; it won &apos;t , until recently , cover diet and lifestyle .
now , there &apos;s no mystery in how you lose weight ; you either burn more calories by exercise or you eat fewer calories .
now , the problem with the Atkins diet , everybody knows people who have lost weight on it , but you can lose weight on amp@@ he@@ tam@@ ines , you know , and f@@ en-@@ ph@@ en .
I mean , there are lots of ways of losing weight that aren &apos;t good for you .
the word yoga comes from the Sanskrit , meaning &quot; union , to yo@@ ke , to bring together . &quot;
and , of course , watch it fall from the sky and flow in our wonderful rivers , but for several other reasons as well .
I had the pleasure of being close to this large king cobra who had caught a ven@@ om@@ ous pit vi@@ per .
it p@@ ours out millions of gallons every hour , and supplies drinking water to at least 300 million people , and washes many , many babies , and of course feeds many , many animals , both domestic and wild , produces thousands of tons of rice .
but I sort of -- there is an innocence in these animals .
as I said , it &apos;s just like a little snack for him , you know ?
but ... maybe not .
we went through a process of elimination and a process of discovery with David , and we ruled out , of course , swapping actors .
I &apos;ll roll that for you now . this was the first test for Benjamin Button .
I &apos;m sure many of you have seen motion capture .
and he came up with this idea of F@@ aci@@ al Action Co@@ ding System , or F@@ AC@@ S .
and then , again , the final shot .
the next section here , I &apos;m going to just blast through this , because we could do a whole TEDTalk on the next several slides .
we had to create a lighting system .
we worked from dental mol@@ ds of Brad .
and this is footage from a hidden camera in a button .
there were four of us -- two Bedouin drivers -- and you can just imagine , this expanse is an ocean of sand , 105 degrees , one water bottle .
and they said , &quot; Ah , no problem ! we just get out and walk . &quot;
one water bottle -- remember , guys -- four people .
he will ur@@ inate and spin his tail to spread the urine around and make him more attractive .
my dried bones are pri@@ zed as a sort of ivory .
and we &apos;ve seen that repeatedly through this conference -- not just this year , but in past years .
because the mixing of those two media is a sort of unnatural or unnecessary act .
&quot; do you realize that if you had started building the Parthen@@ on on the day you were born , you would be all done in only one more year ?
thank you . thank you .
it &apos;s important to show not just to show the leader , but the followers , because you find that new followers emulate the followers , not the leader .
and I decided to try to get smarter by reading the entire Encyclopedia Britannica from A to Z -- or , more precisely , from &quot; a-@@ ak &quot; to &quot; Z@@ y@@ wi@@ ec . &quot;
the junk food industry is really great at pressing our pleasure buttons and figuring out what &apos;s the most pleasurable .
to give just one example , we love crun@@ ch@@ iness , mouth@@ feel .
we don &apos;t know what any of these symbols mean .
perhaps that big ?
but deciphering the script is a very challenging task .
and I &apos;d like to describe some of the results that we have found .
at the very top you find the uniformly random sequence , which is a random jumble of letters -- and interestingly , we also find the DNA sequence from the human genome and instrumental music .
so what could possibly change this terrible gap that has opened up in the world today ?
did you touch it ?
CA : I did .
there &apos;s an ant crawling up a vertical surface .
you see what happens ?
to finish : we &apos;ve gotten design secrets from nature by looking at how feet are built .
when you looked in her eyes , any girl at the age of eleven is looking forward to the future , but there was an unre@@ achable sadness in that girl &apos;s eyes and if I could have translated that to the rest of the world for that moment , I believe that all the work that it had done for the global HIV / AIDS fund would be rewarded by people being prepared to make donations .
in the Rwanda Children &apos;s Museum , there is a photograph of a 10-year-old boy and the Children &apos;s Museum is commemor@@ ating the lives that were lost in the Rwandan genocide where a million people died .
if we were having this TED meeting in our grandparents &apos; day , that might not be so big a claim .
and I &apos;m not talking here about just experts who are telling you what you &apos;re seeing , but really people who are passionate about the various no@@ oks and cr@@ ann@@ ies of the universe , who can share their enthusiasm and can make the universe a welcoming place .
a lot of my career has been devoted to trying to understand how these animals use their learning , use the ability to change what you say based on what you hear in their own communication systems .
in terms of the shipping noise , the International Mari@@ time Organization of the United Nations has formed a group whose job is to establish guidelines for quieting ships , to tell the industry how you could quiet ships .
then we were victims of the French .
what are we going to do ?
thank you .
I &apos;ll tell you what to do with your fingers , same thing .
OK ? here we go .
does it really have anything to do with anything in my life ?
to have a conversation with it . to speak . to listen .
as your skill increases , you learn to find those tinier spaces , those tinier movements . thanks .
I &apos;m actually leading up to something , the newest thing that I &apos;m working on . this is not it .
so , I &apos;m off in my new direction with this to explore rhythm and space .
and so we &apos;ll continue to focus on products , as we always have .
and I think you &apos;re starting to see that , and it &apos;s making our job even more enjoyable .
and so then the object -- the merchandise that you &apos;re interested in -- can be scanned . it &apos;s taken into the dressing room , and in the dressing room there are scanners so that we know exactly what clothing you have in the dressing room .
this is CBS Sunday Morning that aired about two weeks ago .
and to this date -- he &apos;s been gone for only a few years -- he &apos;s started 19@@ ,000 companies .
in the question of consciousness and artificial intelligence , artificial intelligence has really , like the study of consciousness , gotten nowhere . we have no idea how consciousness works .
radio waves . there &apos;s another thing .
what &apos;s the point of these radio waves that you &apos;ve found ? &quot;
ladies and gentlemen , a picture is not worth a thousand words .
now we &apos;re thinking , what data can we release ?
well which one should I use ?
for instance , this one .
pretty much for the vast majority of history , no one gave a damn about 1950 .
but if you want to reach the very top , you should delay gratification and , of course , become a politician .
so what happened is , of course , this is just a mistake .
ELA : people have been using this for all kinds of fun purposes .
so , &quot; Son@@ ority is time and meaning &quot; -- a great quote .
how many birds am I hearing ?
do you remember , I gave you those filters at the beginning .
no , I &apos;m going to tell you there &apos;s something else , and it &apos;s really fundamental , and this is what it is : there &apos;s another reason why we don &apos;t have a good brain theory , and it &apos;s because we have an intuitive , stron@@ gl@@ y-@@ held , but incorrect assumption that has prevented us from seeing the answer .
all the mountains and the continents are kind of floating around on top of the Earth , you know ? it &apos;s like , it doesn &apos;t make any sense .
it &apos;s got good eyes and ears and touch senses and so on , a mouth and a nose . it has very complex behavior .
anywhere where we &apos;re basically using our brain , but not doing a lot of mechanics .
and the richest people over there -- there &apos;s one billion people -- and they live above what I call the &quot; air line , &quot; because they spend more than $ 80 a day on their consumption .
and they consume more than $ 40 per day .
or , to be more precise , how do most of the women in the world wash ?
first , population growth .
and they &apos;ll get a two-@@ child family without a stop in population growth .
but until they have the same energy consumption per person , they shouldn &apos;t give advice to others -- what to do and what not to do .
but the book is not the best shape for the dictionary .
if this was the dictionary -- if this was the map of American English -- look , we have a kind of lumpy idea of Florida , but there &apos;s no California !
when I got my current job , I was given a good piece of advice , which was to interview three politicians every day .
in one of my books , I joke that Ben &amp; Jerry &apos;s should make a paci@@ fist toothpaste -- doesn &apos;t kill germs , just asks them to leave .
they put them into a brain scan machine -- this is apoc@@ ryp@@ hal by the way , but I don &apos;t care -- and they had them watch a horror movie , and then they had them describe their feelings toward their wives .
the first gift , or talent , is mind@@ sight -- the ability to enter into other people &apos;s minds and learn what they have to offer .
the conscious mind hun@@ gers for success and prestige .
and the way in which you could think about us as a species and us as a planet had just changed so much , and it was incredibly exciting .
but out in the landscape , one gigawatt is on the order of 50 square miles of bulldo@@ zed desert .
over the ocean , it &apos;s not even land .
so that leaves a couple of places like Iran , maybe Venezuela , that you would like to have very close surveillance of anything that goes on with fi@@ ssi@@ le stuff .
so if you were in Palm Springs ...
we Americans bought Alaska in the 18@@ 50s . it &apos;s called Se@@ ward &apos;s folly .
the ability for us to access these resources to gain planetary redundancy -- we can now gather all the information , the genetic codes , you know , everything stored on our databases , and back them up off the planet , in case there would be one of those disastrous situations .
and in fact , the large corporations , the governments , can &apos;t take the risk .
what kind of forms could we design if we wouldn &apos;t work with references anymore ?
what made me do it ? at school , I will admit this : academically , I couldn &apos;t express myself .
and from there I was watching this little world .
and the actual roof is made up of a fiber , which I found in my sister &apos;s old teddy bear .
so I did .
because it &apos;s such a small sculpture , nothing can go wrong .
and it went ...
so I think women in our society are becoming leaders , because they realize that for their future generations , it &apos;s very important to maintain our cultural identities .
some of you might have heard of the Alg@@ erian artist Ba@@ ya Ma@@ hi@@ e@@ dd@@ ine , but I doubt a lot of people know that this artist worked in Picasso &apos;s studio in Paris in the 1930s .
and those of you who are employers know exactly what I mean .
but don &apos;t ignore what you &apos;ve asked them to do .
and at that minute , you felt at one with the universe -- one with that jug of water , one with every human being , one with the Cre@@ ator -- and you felt you were in the presence of power , of awe , of the deepest love , the deepest sense of compassion and mercy that you have ever experienced in your lives .
I would reach out to six men from all parts of my life and ask them to be present in the passages of my daughters &apos; lives .
&quot; they &apos;ll have loving families and welcoming homes , but they may not have me .
second , men only .
now Jeff led this trip I took to Europe when I graduated from high school in the early 1980s .
approach the cow . &quot;
he said , &quot; I don &apos;t see the wall , &quot; and I &apos;m telling you the same , Don &apos;t see the wall .
he &apos;s the president of the International Society of Limb Sal@@ vage , which is the least euphem@@ istic term I &apos;ve ever heard .
I wrote a letter to my girls that appears at the end of my book , &quot; The Council of Dads , &quot; and I listed these lessons , a few of which you &apos;ve heard here today : approach the cow , pack your fli@@ p@@ flo@@ ps , don &apos;t see the wall , live the questions , harvest miracles .
so if you go to 23andMe , or if you go to coun@@ ci@@ lo@@ f@@ dad@@ s.com , you can click on a link .
she does very complex tasks , and I haven &apos;t got time to go into them , but the amazing thing about this female is she doesn &apos;t like making mistakes .
and that &apos;s not just in the far-@@ away developing world ; that &apos;s everywhere .
and I looked in the eyes of my little grandchildren , and think how much we &apos;ve harmed this planet since I was their age .
so , the Roots and Shoots program involves youth in three kinds of projects .
and these are projects to make the world around them a better place .
but also -- and this is so important -- to communicate their despair , to say , &quot; We &apos;ve tried this and it doesn &apos;t work , and what shall we do ? &quot;
know the facts , but see how they fit in the big picture .
and so these are the things we will try to do in the lab , make some experiments that have one or more of these characteristics of life .
it &apos;s actually quite lifeless . once it forms , it doesn &apos;t really do anything .
it is moving around , exploring its environment , and re@@ modeling its environment , as you see , by these chemical waves that are forming by the protocell .
so now that you &apos;re all experts on protocells , we &apos;re going to play a game with these protocells .
they look really good , very nice movement , and also they appear to have some kind of behavior where they kind of circle around each other and follow each other , similar to what we &apos;ve seen before -- but again , working with just primordial conditions , no pure chemicals .
very lucky .
by creating engineered micro landscapes to infiltrate in them , we don &apos;t prevent them from being used as emergency vehicle parking spaces , because , of course , a fire@@ truck can come and park there .
so there &apos;s another function on here .
they &apos;re a form of entertainment , they &apos;re a form of art , a pride of ownership .
and if you look at projections over the next 10 to 15 to 20 years , it looks like the world car park could grow to on the order of 1.1 billion vehicles .
and a lot of people say , how do you sleep at night when you &apos;re ru@@ stling with a problem of that magnitude ?
.
but every time I would return from my trips I &apos;d return back to New York City .
they &apos;ve been exposed to this idea of our society , of our prosperity .
a lot of times , when I do a talk like this , I talk about things that everybody in this room I &apos;m sure has already heard of , but most people haven &apos;t .
if you are living in one of the places where the roughly half-@@ billion un@@ accounted for mines are scattered , you can fl@@ ing these seeds out into the field .
and as they grow up , they will grow up around the mines , their roots will detect the chemicals in them , and where the flowers turn red you don &apos;t step .
some of the stuff we share is stuff we &apos;ve found .
you come for the money , you don &apos;t come to Barefoot College .
he is my psychoanalyst . he is my teacher .
so I took the husbands along .
you don &apos;t choose the written word .
they go back and solar-elec@@ tri@@ fy their own village .
&quot; what happens if she runs off with an Indian man ? &quot;
now what does a pre-frontal cortex do for you that should justify the entire architectural overhaul of the human skull in the blink of evolutionary time ?
this is a 50-@@ year-old paradigm called the &quot; free choice paradigm . &quot;
at night you can see what happened in a second ; in daytime , we call them land sharks .
they &apos;re yelling deploy . voices : Oh shit .
it &apos;s called , &quot; You &apos;re Go@@ ing to Miss Me . &quot;
I &apos;m yan@@ king them in from the back . I &apos;m doing double knots .
I said , &quot; Yeah , yeah , yeah , yeah , but come on , come on , come on . &quot;
but you know .
but she pauses occasionally and says , &quot; How do you spell that ? what year ? OK . &quot;
information should be free , and access to information should be free , and we should be charging people for carbon .
and for those of you whose lives have been touched by mental illness , you know how challenging it can be .
none of us can predict the future , but we do know one thing about it and that &apos;s that it ain &apos;t gonna go according to plan .
it &apos;s not a happy thought , but your kids could get mixed up in gangs or bad scenes .
I love the way that they see the world , because they &apos;re seeing the world for the first time .
I mean , we &apos;re the only ones with architecture and agriculture .
to honor and remember .
DR : yeah . and the city actually -- through Tim Z@@ ag@@ at initially , and then through Chri@@ sty@@ ne Nicholas , then we got to Giuliani -- said , &quot; You know we don &apos;t want to do anything with P@@ ier 94 right now , but we have an observation platform for the families down at Ground Zero that we &apos;d like to be a more dignified experience for the families , and a way to protect it from the weather . &quot;
there was no filter .
so yeah , I think there is a chance to re-@@ look at how we think about cities .
so I thought that would be good to end with .
prices for AR@@ Vs , the drugs needed to treat HIV , cost about 12,000 &#91; dollars &#93; per patient per year .
it isn &apos;t only the number of drugs that are patented .
the pool is already working today , two months later , with generic manufacturers to make sure that this product can go to market at low cost where and when it is needed . this is unprecedented .
I spend a lot of time teaching adults how to use visual language and doodling in the workplace .
so I may have forgotten to mention that my son is an only child .
so this man , his name is Sa@@ th@@ i Sh@@ ri .
it &apos;s 2,@@ 200 people in the year 2000 .
this is known as transi@@ tivity in networks .
and using this intense study of individuals , we find that it &apos;s not one particular generation that &apos;s doing better than the others , but the same individuals over time come to report relatively greater positive experience .
we might spend time with people we don &apos;t even like because it &apos;s somehow interesting .
my father , who is 92 , likes to say , &quot; Let &apos;s stop talking only about how to save the old folks and start talking about how to get them to save us all . &quot;
the Lakota are one of many tribes that were moved off their land to prisoner of war camps now called reservations .
you &apos;ll see a lot of people in my photographs today , and I &apos;ve become very close with them , and they &apos;ve welcomed me like family .
the last chapter in any successful genocide is the one in which the oppressor can remove their hands and say , &quot; My God , what are these people doing to themselves ?
for us , it &apos;s a problem , the people in this room .
nine hundred and ninety-nine miles went well , the last mile &apos;s proving incredibly stubborn .
well , look at some old ways , some ways that we &apos;d already cracked .
ready ? go .
&quot; Oh , this is a good idea . people will like this . let &apos;s put it out there . &quot;
when the magazine -- actually , when I got the subscription -- it was 12 following pages .
this is a little spot that we filmed there that &apos;s to be displayed on the large J@@ um@@ bo@@ Tr@@ ons in Singapore .
and , of course , it &apos;s one that &apos;s dear to my heart , because all of these sentiments -- some banal , some a bit more profound -- all originally had come out of my diary .
we don &apos;t usually think of our kitchen as an electrical engineering lab or little kids as circuit designers , but maybe we should .
one item here was water , right ?
which one shall have a good poker hand ?
Lennart Green : three -- good .
Jack of spades .
but you can relax , because it takes half an hour before it works , so you have plenty of time to see my whole performance .
which size ? it &apos;s a piece of cake . I like challenges .
which size ?
maybe I &apos;ll stand up . half .
LG : four . is five the next card ?
LG : yes ? you see that in the screen ?
and this is face up , and it &apos;s not at the bottom here .
Zoe : five . LG : yeah -- I will reverse it face up here .
good . Oh .
actually , you cannot be tone-deaf . nobody is tone-deaf .
and I &apos;ve one last request before I play this piece all the way through .
all of the scale goes to Coca-Cola and Burger King .
well , this created a real problem for these people , right ?
so it allows it to roll .
this would be grown , I suppose , with nanotechnology in the future sometime .
so we have a physical plan of how to make this actually happen .
it would also be able to be an open code , so people could interact with it .
so G@@ luc@@ ks@@ berg did another experiment similar to this where he presented the problem in a slightly different way , like this up here . okay ?
and so , for tasks like this , a narrow focus , where you just see the goal right there , zoom straight ahead to it , they work really well .
people offered the medium level of rewards did no better than people offered the small rewards .
that &apos;s the American experience .
they call them FedEx Days .
let me give you an even more radical example of it : something called the Res@@ ul@@ ts On@@ ly Work Environment , the RO@@ W@@ E , created by two American consultants , in place in place at about a dozen companies around North America .
10 years ago you could not have found a single sober economist anywhere on planet Earth who would have predicted the Wikipedia model .
let &apos;s look at the first video .
now look at me . &quot; A@@ aaaa@@ ah , &quot; and I stop you . let &apos;s go .
but ... There is a vac@@ ancy for a ...
so he says , &quot; If I &apos;m -- if I &apos;m responsible for Mozart , this is going to be the only story to be told .
and it &apos;s an idea that I think is very prevalent at these TED Tal@@ ks , the idea that we can invent our way out of a profound economic and energy crisis , that a move to a knowledge economy can somehow neatly side@@ step those energy constraints , the idea that we &apos;ll discover some fabulous new source of energy that will mean we can sweep all concerns about energy security to one side , the idea that we can step off neatly onto a completely renewable world .
we can &apos;t create new land and new energy systems at the click of a mouse .
and there are thousands of others who are at what we call the mul@@ ling stage .
because I think stories are vital here .
so it &apos;s systemic across the entire country .
in a situation where you have growth , you put the new money into this .
we can get some things out on the Internet .
most of the things mentioned in our 1981 paper were facts .
there would be no stable shoreline .
if we start next year , it is six percent per year .
I &apos;m a stunt coordin@@ ator . and as well as perform stunts I often design them .
and that &apos;s Cent@@ re Point in London .
and it doesn &apos;t look far different when it &apos;s inflated , as you can see from the picture down there .
they have become frightened of being wrong .
and the result is that we are educating people out of their creative capacities . Picasso once said this -- he said that all children are born artists .
he &apos;d known her for a month .
but you know , she &apos;s doing -- no , she &apos;s good at some things -- but if she &apos;s cooking , you know , she &apos;s dealing with people on the phone , she &apos;s talking to the kids , she &apos;s painting the ceiling , she &apos;s doing open-heart surgery over here .
and I &apos;m not a trained academic .
I think I was supposed to talk about my new book , which is called &quot; B@@ link , &quot; and it &apos;s about snap judgments and first impressions .
and finally , he had a breakthrough . V@@ la@@ sic P@@ ick@@ les came to him , and they said , &quot; Mr. Moskowitz -- Doctor Moskowitz -- we want to make the perfect pickle . &quot; and he said , &quot; There is no perfect pickle ; there are only perfect pick@@ les . &quot;
why is this critical ? it &apos;s critical because this is the way the food industry thought before Howard . right ?
but that &apos;s only if you look at the monitor as a page , but not if you look at the monitor as a window .
and it &apos;s a charming read .
now let me give you an example from my act .
that &apos;s an entire childhood in three words .
how far back does that go ? how far back does modern language go ?
they ran around corners , they went up sides of buildings , and they mel@@ ded into the architecture .
and there &apos;s the building . everything was painted -- typography over the whole damn thing , including the air conditioning ducts .
and this is the bridge they &apos;re actually painting up and preparing as we speak .
this is Manhattan , one from the series .
you know , if you give Mother Nature enough time , that is what she will produce .
and it &apos;s also a great place to go down south because the water &apos;s warmer , and the Molas are kind of friendly down there .
and it hasn &apos;t been published , so it &apos;s totally priv@@ y information just for TED .
now that &apos;s important , though , because if there &apos;s a lot of fishing pressure , that population doesn &apos;t get replen@@ ished .
and so I just figured I &apos;d have the questions answered , and I &apos;d be able to thank my funders , like National Geographic and Lindbergh .
so as you can see here , this is a , el@@ even@@ -@@ inch diameter circuit board .
and the shutter speed of the camera actually makes it slightly less effective in this case .
just then , with a loud bang , the heavens opened .
and Mr. Ber@@ lus@@ con@@ i knows it , as he sits at@@ op this huge empire of media and television and so on and so forth .
well , millions of people around the world die of waterborne disease every year .
too small for detection , it &apos;s your built-in protection .
look what we &apos;ve ...
so , he wasn &apos;t only thinking about them ; he built one . this is the machine he built .
the machine was actually used mainly for doing bomb calculations .
they didn &apos;t fit in at the Institute .
they were real sol@@ der@@ ing-@@ gun type guys , and they actually built this thing .
&quot; code error , machine not guilty . &quot;
but interestingly , Anonymous does not make use of its hacked information for financial gain .
Dimit@@ ry Gol@@ u@@ bo@@ v , aka SC@@ RI@@ P@@ T -- born in O@@ de@@ ssa , Ukra@@ ine in 1982 .
this is preventable disease . waste of life .
what , in this kind of climate ? they don &apos;t deserve it .
you know , it &apos;s been kind of in this sort of tight box for a long , long time .
Jo : what do you think this is ? child : I don &apos;t know .
every kid has the right to milk at school .
there &apos;s our milk . there &apos;s our car@@ ton .
you know , it &apos;s local cooks teaching local people .
we need to recognize the experts and the angels quickly , identify them , and allow them to easily find the resource to keep rolling out what they &apos;re already doing , and doing well .
there is so much darkness and secrecy surrounding them .
and at first I thought , &quot; Oh great , I &apos;ll hear about wonderful orgas@@ ms , and great sex lives , and how women love their vaginas . &quot;
and I wanted to stop doing the &quot; Vagina Monologues &quot; because it felt too daunting . I felt like a war photographer who takes pictures of terrible events , but doesn &apos;t intervene on their behalf .
I want to talk about three particular people that I &apos;ve met , vagina warriors , who really transformed my understanding of this whole principle and species , and one is a woman named Mar@@ sha L@@ opez .
there &apos;s a woman named Esther Cha@@ ve@@ z who I met in Juarez , Mexico . and Esther Cha@@ ve@@ z was a brilliant accountant in Mexico City ; she was 72 years old ; and she was planning to retire .
and in the Masai community , goats and cows are the most valued possession .
that was a very Hungarian thing to do , as anyone will at@@ test who remembers 1956 .
well , maybe he was too trusting , because he stayed where he was long after the Nazi An@@ sch@@ l@@ uss in Austria and even after the arre@@ sts and de@@ por@@ tations began in Budapest .
&quot; E@@ z a mi mun@@ k@@ ank ; es ne@@ m is k@@ eves . Yo napot , pacak ! &quot;
and those have been linked then with the rather alarming , growing rates of obesity , shown in these maps here , and that obesity has also been triggering great increases in heart disease and diabetes to the point where a child born today has a one-@@ in-@@ three chance of developing diabetes .
never underestimate the power of food to turn a place around and make it a destination .
sometimes , it &apos;s all at once .
I led a team that was asked to imagine Atlanta 100 years from now .
and I close with this image of democracy in action : this is a protest that &apos;s happening on a retrofit in Silver Spring , Maryland on an A@@ stro@@ turf town green .
tapestries were portable . you could roll them up , send them ahead of you , and in the time it took to hang them up , you could transform a cold , d@@ ank interior into a rich@@ ly colored setting .
I think for most Americans , knowledge of the Islamic world was pretty slight before 9 / 11 , and then it was thrust upon us in one of America &apos;s darkest hours , and the perception was through the polar@@ ization of that terrible event .
it &apos;s our home . we welcome them .
so I went to Russia , and my mother also , &#91; during the &#93; time of &#91; the &#93; Soviet Union .
and my question is this : &quot; why are we ignoring the oceans ? &quot;
this is all accurate except for one thing -- it &apos;s pitch black .
it turns out that 90 percent of all the oceanographic intellect in this country are at 12 universities . they &apos;re all on I-@@ 2 .
and when you get a jaw drop , you can inform .
in some parts of the world , for example , South Africa , education is just not readily accessible .
and of course these simple retrieval questions are not the end of the story .
and the object is the passive no-@@ voice .
until you read , as I did , an ad in the Los Angeles Times .
I read a book by a woman named Amy Rich@@ lin , who is the chair of the C@@ las@@ s@@ ics department at USC .
and that &apos;s really what I &apos;m looking for .
and one of these is boundary crossing .
you &apos;re young . I &apos;m old . who &apos;s going to see it ?
there the alternative just bo@@ ggles the imagination .
that , and I will say this to the scientists , that the trickster has the ability to hold his ideas lightly so that he can let room in for new ideas or to see the contradictions or the hidden problems with his ideas .
ten years ago , you couldn &apos;t have found an astronomer -- well , very few astronomers -- in the world who would &apos;ve told you that there are any planets anywhere outside our solar system .
this is one of the things they ought to be thinking more about .
the worst possibility is that a very simple germ , like staph , for which we have one antibiotic that still works , mutates .
astronomers estimate that little asteroids like that come about every hundred years .
it &apos;s an astonishing insight , and we have only found out about this recently .
we applaud the well-@@ man@@ nered box .
these are the dimensions that I like to work with .
our emotions are complex .
and yet , I do believe that in every social space , in every public space , there is a desire to communicate more than just that blunt thought , that blunt technique , but something that pinpoints , and can point in various directions forward , backward , sideways and around .
but I rather play something completely unheard of , and even with flaws , than repeat the same thing over and over which has been hollowed by its meaning@@ lessness .
it &apos;s an art of communication .
and I think , of course , risk is what underlies the world .
compromise , if it &apos;s artistic , if it is able to cope with its strategies -- and there is my first sketch and the last rendering -- it &apos;s not that far away .
this is where I &apos;m coming from .
the best one , like my father -- I &apos;m not campaigning for my father -- they were put in charge to stop others from poaching .
business communities helped bring Namibia onto the world map and they have also helped make wildlife a very valuable land use like any other land uses such as agriculture .
and so far , with the support of World Wildlife Fund , we &apos;ve been able to scale up the very small programs to national programs today .
so please , if you go to Namibia , make sure that you stay in the tents .
we knew conservation would fail if it doesn &apos;t work to improve the lives of the local communities .
the changes are happening . they &apos;re very visible .
if everybody in the developed world understood this graph , and em@@ bla@@ zoned it on the inside of their fore@@ heads , there would be no further societal argument about climate change because this is the story that counts .
and on up to Greenland .
it tends to go in these pulses , about every three days , but on average , 125 feet a day , twice the rate it did 20 years ago .
one of the other things we did was begin to diversify the species that we served -- small silver@@ fish , an@@ cho@@ vi@@ es , m@@ ack@@ er@@ el , sar@@ din@@ es were uncommon .
I remember well the meals of my childhood .
but what , you may ask , do a Polish poet , a British D@@ ame , a country music hall of fam@@ er all have in common besides this totally excellent Google ranking ?
to understand how Tumor Treating Fields work , we first need to understand what are electric fields .
we &apos;re , of course , all stuck in the Earth &apos;s gravitational field right now .
we &apos;ll see two cells in the upper part of the screen attempting to divide .
and a year after that treatment , his tumor grew back with a venge@@ ance .
she is managing her farm .
now , you don &apos;t find any k@@ und ; they are all submerged .
so , you can find through your Jeep , a camel , and a cart .
these are the trees .
it was never popular with many political leaders , especially those in the United States who somehow thought that new media would be able to do what missiles couldn &apos;t .
instead of trying to pur@@ ge these comments , they instead went and reached out to the bloggers .
now Ken@@ dall on the other hand -- and like I said , he &apos;s only 15 months older than her -- he &apos;d come to me crying , it &apos;s like as soon as I would hear him cry , a clock would go off .
and he was hanging out with all us younger guys .
because , while Sheila never said no , she also never said yes .
and it was a hot day and he said , &quot; Hey , would you like some fresh coconut water ? &quot;
I had a friend , a history major like me , who was acc@@ os@@ ted at S@@ chi@@ ph@@ ol Airport in Amsterdam , by an anxi@@ ously per@@ spiring European saying , &quot; You &apos;re Indian , you &apos;re Indian ! can you help me fix my laptop ? &quot;
and it &apos;s the nationalism of an idea that essentially says you can endure differences of caste , creed , color , culture , cuisine , custom and costume , consonant , for that matter , and still rally around a consensus .
our antibiotics are running out .
you can stick this to something called a DNA ap@@ tam@@ er .
an example of an organism or two that happens to be quite immortal would be plant seeds or bacterial spores .
I was interested in what was going on in the bag , the bag on the toy store shelf where those shrimp sat in suspended animation indefinitely .
and it &apos;s true . it &apos;s true .
so we wondered what would happen if we took our suspended animals and exposed them to the cold .
and so , what we found out was that , if you take animals that are animated like you and I , and you make them cold -- that is , these were the garden worms -- now they &apos;re dead .
we also found out that we could subject animals to otherwise lethal blood loss , and we could save them if we gave them hydrogen sulfide .
over six million years , we and the chimps evolved our different ways .
we use it in a pretty pragmatic way , to be honest .
so , they &apos;re great examples , I think , of exploration and experimentation in design .
so the average Western first-@@ gra@@ der spends as much as 50 percent of their play time taking part in what &apos;s called &quot; construction play . &quot;
it &apos;s class@@ ically learning by doing .
but the important idea is that everything &apos;s at hand , everything &apos;s around .
this is a nurse using a very simple -- as you can see -- plas@@ tic@@ ine prototype , explaining what she wants out of a portable information system to a team of technologists and designers that are working with her in a hospital .
he wants to know what it feels like to be a fire@@ fighter .
we &apos;re trying on these experiences .
play has rules , especially when it &apos;s group play .
and I had the same reaction you did .
I actually was moved to tears when I first saw it .
and the video went viral .
but , I know myself too , I feel this virtual es@@ pr@@ it de corps , if you will , with all of them .
we &apos;re not finished with the video yet .
so what we calculated was that the limbs were moving at the peak speed ranging from 10 meters per second all the way up to 23 meters per second .
and if any of you ever have a chance , backstage of the National Museum of Natural History is one of the world &apos;s best collections of preserved mantis shrimp . and what -- this is serious business for me .
the saddle is outlined in yellow . you can actually see it extending over the course of the strike , and actually hyper@@ extending .
and we were able to get some force measurements out .
for the rocke@@ teers in the audience : I love what you &apos;re doing , I admire the guts , I admire the courage -- but your rockets are pointed in the wrong goddamn direction .
but it &apos;s a question of perception , and if that &apos;s what you &apos;re thinking , if that &apos;s what you think I mean when I say , &quot; This is an ocean planet stupi@@ dly called &apos; Earth . &apos; &quot; if you think that that &apos;s the relative importance , two to one , you &apos;re wrong by a factor of ten .
it features two of these deep rovers , and I can criticize them because these sweet things are mine .
they live in a three-dimensional world where there is no difference in energy between going this way , that way , that way or that way .
OK , this is good stuff .
and this ballet is controlled by this lady here .
and then by moving through the water it &apos;s able to take that control .
so the oyster was the basis for a manife@@ st@@ o-@@ like urban design project that I did about the New York Harbor called &quot; oy@@ ster-@@ tec@@ ture . &quot;
it accepts algae and de@@ tr@@ it@@ us in one end , and through this beautiful , glamorous set of stomach organs , out the other end comes cleaner water .
you can see the eight chambers on the side host little baby oysters and essentially force-@@ feed them .
if you haven &apos;t ordered yet , I generally find the rig@@ at@@ oni with the sp@@ icy tomato sauce goes best with diseases of the small intestine .
and part of -- what &apos;s so interesting about this story to me is that in some ways , it &apos;s a great case study in how cultural change happens , how a good idea eventually comes to win out over much worse ideas .
and so this little girl inadvertently ended up contamin@@ ating the water in this popular pump , and one of the most terrifying outbreaks in the history of England erupted about two or three days later .
and that was the last time that London has seen a cholera outbreak since .
so an entire philosophy , a body of knowledge about the natural world that had been empir@@ ically g@@ leaned over centuries , goes away .
so what I &apos;d like to show you now , in the couple of minutes I have left , is a film that a student made in Guatemala .
but one of the questions is -- this should be , to you -- how come there are so many galaxies ?
there are places where there are no galaxies and there are places where there are thousands of galaxies clum@@ ped together , right .
so I &apos;m going to show you the results of a very large-scale simulation of what we think the universe might be like , using , essentially , some of the play principles and some of the design principles that , you know , humans have labored so hard to pick up , but apparently nature knew how to do at the beginning .
this is how , if you took billions of years to go around , it might look to you , right ?
so this is what we started with 15 years ago , with the Cos@@ mic B@@ ack@@ ground Explorer -- made the map on the upper right , which basically showed us that there were large-scale fluctuations , and actually fluctuations on several scales . you can kind of see that .
it sounds so ordinary , and yet we spend so little time in the present moment that it &apos;s anything but ordinary .
just a moment ago , my daughter Rebecca texted me for good luck .
and many people found this amazing .
we slip into thinking that always being connected is going to make us fell less alone .
and then there &apos;s technology -- simpler , hopeful , optimistic , ever-@@ young .
we spend an evening on the social network instead of going to the pub with friends .
never try to be better than someone else , always learn from others . never cease trying to be the best you can be -- that &apos;s under your control .
I had one of my greatest players that you probably heard of , Bill Wal@@ ton . he came to catch the bus ; we were leaving for somewhere to play .
you and I know deeper down , there &apos;s always a chance to win the crown .
and so the fates are seldom wrong , no matter how they twist and wind .
it really involves many different areas .
plus we have stem cells .
and you can actually see here the prin@@ the@@ ad going through and printing this structure , and it takes about 40 minutes to print this structure .
but it was hard to do that when I was born with sp@@ ina bi@@ fi@@ da and my kidneys and bladder weren &apos;t working .
Thomas Friedman is one of my favorite New York Times colum@@ ni@@ sts , and he poign@@ antly comm@@ ented that 2008 is when we hit a wall , when Mother Nature and the market both said , &quot; No more . &quot;
Caitria and Morgan O &apos;Neill : how to step up in the face of disaster
the town hall and the police department had also suffered direct hits , and so people wanting to help or needing information went to the church .
we need to canvas and send out volunteers .
and you &apos;ve only got about seven days to capture 50 percent of all of the Web searches that will ever be made to help your area .
Mo : we needed canv@@ asing tools , donations datab@@ asing , needs reporting , remote volunteer access , all in an eas@@ y-@@ to-@@ use website .
and if you do the math , that &apos;s 130 people every minute .
and I was thinking this morning of the good life , and before I show you the rest of my presentation , I &apos;m going to violate TED rules here , and I &apos;m going to read you something from my book as quickly as I can .
and it was set in a wider watery ooze .
that &apos;s Su@@ reka G@@ undi ; she also lives with her family on the tent along the same highway median .
I &apos;ve been a priest in the Church for 20 years .
and I &apos;m very aware that when you say the word &quot; God , &quot; many people will turn off immediately .
then , on December 26@@ th last year , just two months ago , that underwater earthquake triggered the tsunami .
I very much relate to this idea of God .
and the idea was to put Mc@@ Sweeney &apos;s -- Mc@@ Sweeney &apos;s Quar@@ terly , that we published twice or three times a year , and a few other magazines -- we were going to move it into an office for the first time .
it used to be in my kitchen in Brooklyn .
and everything was great except the landlord said , &quot; Well , the space is zoned for retail ; you have to come up with something .
we took all that down , and we found beautiful wooden floors , white@@ washed beams and it had the look -- while we were renov@@ ating this place , somebody said , &quot; You know , it really kind of looks like the hull of a ship . &quot;
with like 60 kids a day , this is a problem .
this site will document every story , every project that comes out of this conference and around the world . so you go to the website , you see a bunch of ideas you can be inspired by and then you add your own projects once you get started .
which is sort of the idea that we normally have about what technology is : it &apos;s all that new stuff .
so , we &apos;ve invented ourselves . of all the animals that we have domesticated , the most important animal that we &apos;ve domesticated has been us . okay ?
things in life start out being general cell , and they become specialized : you have tissue cells , you have muscle , brain cells . and same things happens with say , a hammer , which is general at first and becomes more specific .
we have been so consumed with seemingly objective discussions of politics , tactics , weapons , dollars and casualties .
there are two sides of war .
John Maeda on the simple life
who knows Muriel Cooper ? Muriel Cooper ?
because the human thing is very hard when you &apos;re at MIT .
so , if you sort of compare that , like this , you &apos;ll see that computer versus human -- I &apos;ve been tracking this for the last year -- computer versus human over the last year has changed .
and I &apos;ve always felt bad about it , in a sense .
by being at TED , we see so many things at one time .
as you age from infant age , your vision gets better , and maybe in your late teens , early twenties , you &apos;re looking for a mate , and your vision goes after that .
and there are lots of those . but the climate crisis is the rare but all-important global , or strategic , conflict .
we can &apos;t wait for the kind of drought Australia had to change our political culture .
CA : when you look at what the leading candidates in your own party are doing now -- I mean , there &apos;s -- are you excited by their plans on global warming ?
ag : the answer to the question is hard for me because , on the one hand , I think that we should feel really great about the fact that the Republican nominee -- certain nominee -- John McCain , and both of the fin@@ alists for the Democratic nomination -- all three have a very different and forward-@@ leaning position on the climate crisis . all three have offered leadership , and all three are very different from the approach taken by the current administration . and I think that all three have also been responsible in putting forward plans and proposals . but the campaign dialogue that -- as illustrated by the questions -- that was put together by the League of Conservation V@@ ot@@ ers , by the way , the analysis of all the questions -- and , by the way , the debates have all been sponsored by something that goes by the Or@@ wel@@ lian label , &quot; Clean Co@@ al . &quot; has anybody noticed that ?
CA : Al Gore , thank you so much for coming to TED .
one of the assignments for a year was to work with in-vitro meat .
and same thing here , Social Tele@@ -@@ presence .
it used to be called rapid prototyping , rapid modeling .
techniques became better -- not only carving but also stere@@ oli@@ th@@ ography and laser -- solidifying all kinds of resins , whether in powder or in liquid form . and the vats became bigger , to the point that now we can have actual chairs made by rapid manufacturing .
design for De@@ bate is a very interesting new endeavor that designers have really shaped for themselves .
the opposite happened .
naturally 7 beat@@ boxes a whole band
while we all agree that compassion is a great idea , Rabbi Tab@@ ick ac@@ knowle@@ dges there are challenges to its execution . she explains how a careful balance of compassion and justice allows us to do good deeds , and keep our sanity .
and all the main religions have similar teachings .
what does it mean , &quot; dough becomes leaven &quot; ?
and the rabbi said , &quot; You &apos;ve misunderstood me .
now , I want you to imagine that I &apos;m stro@@ king it with this .
enjoy it while it lasts .
but what is most important here is , who do we finance ?
governor comes to him one day , actually invites him to come to his office .
if there are investors willing to finance U.S. government budget deficit , why wouldn &apos;t we find investors willing to finance press freedom deficit ?
I think even NASA can do that , and they proved that they can .
presumably , they mean something supernatural .
but before I finished , the chief of the barb@@ arians stood up and said , &apos; But wait , you haven &apos;t told us about the greatest ruler of them all .
when I open my eyes and I see my sons in the place where my father once sat , I feel an invisible loyalty and love linking my sons to the grandfather whose face they never had a chance to see , but whose heart and soul they have come to know through all the stories I have told .
and that very night Cyrus , king of the Persians , entered Babylon and the whole regime of Belshazzar fell .
and , not surprisingly , they tell you that all this was done by Marduk .
and the debate un@@ sett@@ les everybody in the 19th century to realize that the Hebrew scriptures are part of a much wider world of religion .
the state of Israel is setup , and 50 years later , in the late 60s , it &apos;s clear that Britain &apos;s role as the imperial power is over .
it was a huge event .
this is the other side of that same picture .
this forming of the powerful attachment between child and parent provides the building blocks for physical , social , language , cognitive and psych@@ om@@ ot@@ or development .
and at that point , I read a book by Frank Bar@@ nab@@ y , this wonderful nuclear physicist , and he said that media had a responsibility , that all sectors of society had a responsibility to try and progress things and move things forward .
and I rang Sir Bob Ay@@ ling , who was CEO of BA at the time , and said , &quot; M@@ ate , we &apos;ve got this invitation .
so he said yes , and we found ourselves in Afghanistan .
we see it as a window of opportunity .
and that meant that humanitarian workers wouldn &apos;t be kidnapped or killed .
it &apos;s all about you and me .
if you put one drop , one drop of something , in that water , it &apos;ll change it forever .
now , my first pointed and memorable experience with leadership in Ghana occurred when I was 16 years old .
I mean , it &apos;s the people there who are so hardworking , persistent , creative , empowered .
this was not the world that I &apos;d want my children to grow up in .
and a month into it , I come to the office , and I have this email from one of our students .
that for many of them , it has been a life-@@ altering experience .
this is the place where we make the legs .
a bomb fell not far from my car -- well , far enough , but big noise .
among them there was my right-hand man , Najmuddin .
also one of the physical therap@@ ists reported that Mahmoud could be provided with a leg , but not immediately .
it was April , I remember , a very beautiful day .
now help me not to be a beg@@ gar anymore . &quot;
I said , &quot; Okay . &quot;
the comment of Najmuddin was Mahmoud has something to prove .
Mahmoud had looked taller .
these are Q@@ -@@ tips stuck to my roommate with wig glue .
this is a full bottle of Cal@@ ms For@@ te .
first question : if I want to ask them to call up -- because they do hear them through the ear .
he &apos;s saying to me , &apos; Electr@@ icity . &apos; was he an electr@@ ician ? &quot; &quot; no . &quot;
and we haven &apos;t heard from her since . strange .
they &apos;re ruined financially and emotionally because they &apos;ve given their money and their faith to these people .
six and a half days , that certainly is a fatal dose .
he died of an overdose .
I think that something needs to be done about this .
we &apos;re waiting for the psychics to come forth and snap at it .
now , you can make all the jokes you want about cow far@@ ts , but methane is 20 times more poisonous than CO2 , and it &apos;s not just methane .
now , my math &apos;s a little shaky , but this is pretty good , and it depends whether a pig is four feet long or five feet long , but you get the idea .
you ate food .
it &apos;s hard to imagine . people grew food , and they ate food .
and chicken soon joined them on the throne .
this may be organic in letter , but it &apos;s surely not organic in spirit .
everybody who has looked at this and studied it agrees .
then , even a one percentage point reduction in the extinction risk could be equivalent to this astronomical number -- 10 to the power of 32 .
intellectual capacity -- let &apos;s take that box , which falls into a lot of different sub-@@ categories : memory , concentration , mental energy , intelligence , empathy .
we &apos;re just lucky that we have the re@@ quis@@ ite neural machinery to process music and to appreciate it and enjoy it .
it &apos;s been done in vol@@ es .
this is the last picture that I want to -- now we &apos;ve got to use the laser pointer .
it &apos;s a part of the space that &apos;s accessible to animals ; since we are animals , we are a subset of that .
so the valves at the bottom of those tubes there are like radi@@ o-@@ controlled airplane valves .
and that &apos;s something that in painting I &apos;ve never seen done .
there are lots of things that appear .
so I started thinking and listing what all it was that I thought would make a perfect biennial .
so I thought , okay , I have to have some criteria of how to choose work .
I know I should mention : I &apos;m making all these things .
this is N@@ ell Rem@@ mel .
if you look at the angles around the fold , you find that if you number the angles in a circle , all the even@@ -@@ numbered angles add up to a straight line , all the odd@@ -@@ numbered angles add up to a straight line .
and it &apos;s so simple .
computers made things move , but these were all real , folded objects that we made .
well , about the only way is to fold it up somehow .
but if we do take account of it , then I think it will go much more smoothly .
and I realized that two things were different this time around .
it was young , single women who were the major purcha@@ sers of houses in the neighborhood .
you &apos;ll see the women in red , and you &apos;ll see the men in blue .
you &apos;ll watch them both drop out of the middle class , but see what happens to women and see what happens to men .
what it &apos;s about is that the economy has changed a lot .
women are getting college degrees at a faster rate than men .
&quot; who &apos;s the damn man ?
YB : and we made a baby .
so my research has been focused more on -- after finding out these things that actually correspon@@ ded to my own experience , I tried to understand : where -- in everyday life , in our normal experience -- do we feel really happy ?
his body disappears , his identity disappears from his consciousness , because he doesn &apos;t have enough attention , like none of us do , to really do well something that requires a lot of concentration , and at the same time to feel that he exists .
this poet describes it as opening a door that floats in the sky -- a very similar description to what Albert Einstein gave as to how he imagined the forces of relativity , when he was struggling with trying to understand how it worked .
your skills are not quite as high as they should be , but you can move into flow fairly easily by just developing a little more skill .
boredom begins to be very aver@@ sive and apathy becomes very negative : you don &apos;t feel that you &apos;re doing anything , you don &apos;t use your skills , there &apos;s no challenge .
but the world has changed , and it &apos;s overdue to upgrade that mindset and that taxonomy of the world , and to understand it .
they will start flying .
so the only way of really getting world population &#91; growth &#93; to stop is to continue to improve child survival to 90 percent .
we worked out a mechanism , which -- NO was helping cells survive .
so what you can do is you can multiply those data by the NO that &apos;s released and you can calculate how much nitric oxide would be released from the skin into the circulation .
at seven years old I figured it out . I got three and a half cents for a thousand coat hangers .
there &apos;s still 13 trillion dollars circulating in the U.S. economy .
in the front , you see , actually , Joe Murray getting the patient ready for the transplant , while in the back room you see Har@@ tw@@ ell Harri@@ son , the Chief of U@@ rology at Harvard , actually harvesting the kidney .
so , your body is constantly re@@ generating .
we coat the outside with these muscle cells .
so I thought I &apos;d start by telling you how I got here .
equally startling , from my point of view , is the fact that no one was drawing any connections between what is happening to the body poli@@ tic , and what is happening in our leading educational institutions .
knowing that if we were to regain the integrity of liberal education , it would take radical rethinking of basic assumptions , beginning with our priorities .
the license for these re@@ mix@@ ers as@@ signs all of the rights to the remix back to Lucas .
I went to this site , and I had to answer these questions .
a conscious approach to design , I &apos;m calling it bio@@ informed design , and I think it &apos;s possible .
a computer in those days was something the secret services used to use for code breaking .
Apple introduced a thing called HyperCard , and they made a bit of a fuss about it .
so , now , there are a lot of web 2.0 consultants who make a lot of money .
basically all that means is that the democratic front page is the best stuff on the web . you find some interesting content , say a TEDTalk , submit it to Reddit , and the community of your peers will vote it up if they like it , vote it down if they don &apos;t .
so , it went from about five percent , which was when this meme started , to 70 percent at the end of voting .
but no longer is the message going to be coming from just the top down .
these are all things that come from the period of the civilization-state .
moreover , this is a very old state tradition , a very old tradition of stat@@ ecraft .
I would w@@ ager it was probably about 200 years ago .
now this is the way things are going to move , because China has a very specific problem , which is different from Europe and different from the United States : China has huge numbers of people and no space .
I was quite proud of that one .
it was the only one I had at that time .
people can tear it , tag on it , or even pee on it -- some are a bit high for that , I agree -- but the people in the street , they are the curator .
we didn &apos;t push the limit ; we just showed that they were further than anyone thought .
during that time , you haven &apos;t thought about what you &apos;re going to eat tomorrow .
so for example , I pasted the photo of the min@@ ar@@ et in Switzerland a few weeks after they voted the law forbidding min@@ are@@ ts in the country .
take the photos , the portraits , upload it -- I &apos;ll give you all the details -- and I &apos;ll send you back your poster . join by groups and reveal things to the world .
what we see changes who we are .
at TED @ Mot@@ or@@ City , Lisa G@@ ansky , author of &quot; The Mes@@ h , &quot; talks about a future of business that &apos;s about sharing all kinds of stuff , either via smart and tech@@ -@@ enabled rental or , more boldly , peer-to-peer . examples across industries -- from music to cars -- show how close we are to this me@@ shy future .
and it &apos;s starting to look at -- not always and not for everything -- but in certain moments of time , access to certain kinds of goods and service will trump ownership of them .
secondly , population growth and density into cities .
in the last year , 2010 , two car companies started , one that &apos;s in the U.K. called W@@ hip@@ Car , and the other one , Rel@@ ay@@ R@@ ides , in the U.S .
in general , and maybe , again , it &apos;s because I &apos;m a tech entrepreneur , I look at things as platforms .
they had some number of big successes .
she &apos;d come every two months to visit me , and then I said I &apos;m the man , I &apos;m the man , and I have to recipro@@ c@@ ate .
notice one thing , we &apos;re equal here .
I can &apos;t deal with any threat . this was a big threat .
that &apos;s my little son .
it took from the Stone Age to achieve that .
it is vital that we do so .
they found it much more motivational , much more exciting than traditional education .
this is one from Yor@@ k@@ shire where , in fact , my nephew , I hope , will be able to attend it .
so it turns out that propulsion isn &apos;t really the problem .
rather , he is entering the water at a 45-@@ degree angle with his fore@@ arm , and then prop@@ elling himself by stream@@ lining -- very important .
asked him what this said .
immediately : death sweat .
secondly , different types of pi@@ v@@ ots .
I couldn &apos;t develop the attributes in my toes , the strength in my feet , to do that .
E : Y@@ ee ha@@ w .
E : happy birthday to you .
SW : and the penguin ?
let &apos;s get that one out of there . how about a chimpanzee ?
E : I &apos;m special .
and everything about Wikipedia is managed by virtually an all-@@ volunteer staff .
you could never afford to have a stand@@ by crew of people 24 hours a day and do what we &apos;re doing at Wikipedia .
the real struggle is not between the right and the left -- that &apos;s where most people assume -- but it &apos;s between the party of the thoughtful and the party of the jer@@ ks .
nobody else saw this but I found it in a book , and I found a link to a page that describes it , and I &apos;m going to clean it up tomorrow , so please don &apos;t delete it , &quot; then it would survive .
well , they managed to get 18 people to show up .
that &apos;s neo-@@ Nazi math for you .
the last time I got an e-mail from a journalist saying , &quot; Why do academics hate Wikipedia ? &quot;
he lived into his 80s , and he was buried beneath this monument in 7@@ 20 A@@ D .
after 1,300 years , these two lovers still touch and kiss from their tom@@ b .
anthropologists have found evidence of romantic love in 170 societies .
pain runs through my body with the fires of my love for you .
as an eigh@@ th-century Japanese poet said , &quot; My longing had no time when it ceases . &quot;
what a bad deal .
as the poet Ter@@ ence , the Roman poet once said , he said , &quot; The less my hope , the hotter my love . &quot;
I &apos;m putting the data together now , and at some point -- there will always be magic to love , but I think I will come closer to understanding why it is you can walk into a room and everybody is from your background , your same general level of intelligence , your same general level of good looks , and you don &apos;t feel pulled towards all of them .
it &apos;s deeply embedded in the brain .
he &apos;s starting to make his climb .
there is Yves Rossy .
BG : we saw the 2009 crossing of the Gi@@ braltar S@@ trait where you lost control and then you dived down into the clouds and in the ocean .
that all that , discovered in 40 years , had not been in the previous hundred thousand , was not for lack of thinking about stars , and all those other urgent problems they had .
here is one . Per@@ se@@ phone wasn &apos;t released .
and they &apos;re in fifteen countries . they &apos;re spread around the world .
these rin@@ ged seals , these are the &quot; fat@@ s@@ icles &quot; of the Arctic .
and I &apos;ve come up , and all I wanted to do was get out of the water .
so she did this threat display for a few minutes , and then the most amazing thing happened -- she totally relaxed .
the best definition of innat@@ eness I &apos;ve ever seen -- this just clari@@ fies so many things for me -- is from the brain scientist Gary Marcus .
on the left , I &apos;ve plotted the scores for liberals ; on the right , those for conservatives ; in the middle , the moder@@ ates .
the Grand Canyon is really simple .
traditional authority , traditional morality can be quite repressive , and restrictive to those at the bottom , to women , to people that don &apos;t fit in .
but they aren &apos;t trained in the same way that police officers are and they &apos;re certainly not equipped in the same way police officers are .
we have begun organizing makers at our Maker Fa@@ ire .
choir : ♫ I &apos;m hooked on a feel@@ in &apos; ♫ ♫ I &apos;m high on believ@@ in &apos; ♫ ♫ That you &apos;re in love with me ♫ DD : so Richard came up from Houston last year to visit us in Detroit here and show the wonderful S@@ ash@@ imi Tab@@ er@@ nacle Choir .
makers today , to some degree , are out on the edge .
they &apos;re a little bit radical .
glamour is a form of fal@@ sification , but fal@@ sification to achieve a particular purpose .
how do you create the sense of transcendence , the sense of evoking a perfect world ?
and there she is -- Grace .
but I also knew how hard they worked all week .
suddenly , I had a body , a body that was pr@@ icked and poked and punc@@ tured , a body that was cut wide open , a body that had organs removed and transported and re@@ arranged and reconstructed , a body that was scanned and had tubes shoved down it , a body that was burning from chemicals .
it was all these things in the water , in the world , in my body .
so I &apos;m going to show you a five-year-old who is getting a standard kind of puzzle that we call the false belief task .
this pirate is called Joshua .
and now what we &apos;ve started to do in my lab is to put children into the brain scanner and ask what &apos;s going on in their brain as they develop this ability to think about other people &apos;s thoughts .
so I &apos;m going to show you a demo of this .
we changed their ability to judge other people &apos;s actions .
the notion that you can understand why a brain works , perhaps .
or maybe a relationship goes up in smoke because we haven &apos;t had the time , or the patience , or the tranqu@@ ility , to be with the other person , to listen to them .
I wanted to investigate this whole roadrunner culture , and what it was doing to me and to everyone else .
every wall , every concrete wall is resisting the stresses and supporting the building .
and again , I felt kind of uncomfortable with the notion that a building the size of the Washington building -- 50,000 square feet -- will sit on that fragile hill and that we will go into galleries -- rooms with doors and sort of familiar rooms -- to tell the story of the Holocaust .
you cross a bridge , you enter this triangular room , 60 feet high , which cuts right into the hill and extends right through as you go towards the north .
that too was a competition , and it is something I &apos;m just beginning to work on .
and this is where it is ; it &apos;s sort of evolving .
I have a quote that I like by a morpho@@ logist , 19@@ 17 , Theodore Cook , who said , &quot; Beau@@ ty con@@ notes humanity .
I &apos;m telling them , &quot; You come with me over this way . &quot;
it felt like it was really important .
if you &apos;re in IT , India , obviously , is the place to be at the moment .
keep that in mind .
then Malé , then further south .
but the wind above is from the northeast monsoon .
and every one of these birds that makes the crossing from India to East Africa eats insects , large insects , the size of dragonflies . thank you very much .
it is this weapon of devastating accuracy and precision .
I didn &apos;t talk about it , but it &apos;s a critical feature .
JH : other questions ? right here .
I don &apos;t think we can get away from those changes .
this is the hottest day of the year somewhere in Eastern Tibet , on August 1 .
but there &apos;s also wicked joy , you can rejoice in someone &apos;s suffering .
we know , by experience , that we can be what we call &quot; a little paradise , &quot; and yet , be completely unhappy within .
you could go from love to hate .
a kind of sense of inner freedom as opposite to intense grasping and obsession .
if you are happy about something , you &apos;ll go more to the left side .
now , the problem of human diversity , like all big scientific questions -- how do you explain something like that -- can be broken down into sub-@@ questions .
because you may notice that what &apos;s actually happening is that the egg is un@@ scrambling itself .
in fact , this gut instinct is reflected in one of the most fundamental laws of physics , the second law of thermodynamics , or the law of entropy .
the universe is tiny ; it &apos;s smaller than an atom .
and that is how our solar system was formed , four and a half billion years ago .
well , it &apos;s here that life introduces an entirely new trick .
and occasionally , there are disasters .
it &apos;s easy to imagine saving money next week , but how about right now ? generally , we want to spend it . economist Sh@@ l@@ omo Ben@@ art@@ zi says this is one of the biggest obstacles to saving enough for retirement , and asks : how do we turn this behavioral challenge into a behavioral solution ?
the average American household spends 1,000 dollars a year on lotteries .
they still have an apple left .
so this notion of loss aversion kicks in when it comes to savings too , because people , mentally and emotionally and intuitively frame savings as a loss because I have to cut my spending .
Hello there .
you &apos;re on with They M@@ ight Be Gi@@ ants .
and I would lie there crying at night because my imagination could not touch creativity .
my bit@@ ches wear my coll@@ ars .
my lady , it is my husband &apos;s child .
but that &apos;s the moment she &apos;s surgically removing herself from that .
and now , what happens is that the people of the upper city , they suck up all the water .
they suck up all the water , keep to themselves , and they drip feed the lower city .
Jason Clay : how big brands can help save biodiversity
I was going to work on international development , and then I took a turn and ended up here .
so let &apos;s go back to Sudan .
we can get efficiency up .
should you be able to buy a product that &apos;s sustainable sitting next to one that isn &apos;t , or should all the products on the shelf be sustainable ?
they may have a lot of opinions about it , but they &apos;re not going to be terribly informed .
now , the price of food , many people complain about , but in fact , the price of food is going down , and that &apos;s odd because in fact , consumers are not paying for the true cost of food .
we need to take what we &apos;ve learned in private , voluntary standards of what the best producers in the world are doing and use that to inform government regulation , so we can shift the entire performance curve .
they taught me about what it means to be a father and to raise a family .
and I talked about this throughout the entire campaign .
we know what fairness and justice and opportunity look like .
and you too , with these same values , can control your own destiny .
her celebrated operatic roles are numerous and varied .
opportunities are une@@ qu@@ ally distributed .
nobody , and no country , can afford to be there , where performance is poor and there are large social disparities .
you also see -- and I think that &apos;s one of the most encouraging findings -- that we no longer live in a world that is neatly divided between rich and well-educated countries , and poor and bad@@ ly-@@ educated ones , a very , very important lesson .
a lot was done to increase the life chances of students with an immigrant background or from social disadvantage .
or traditionally , the German education divides children at the age of 10 , very young children , between those deemed to pursue careers of knowledge workers and those who would end up working for the knowledge workers , and that mainly along socioeconomic lines , and that paradigm is being challenged now too .
and you can see other countries as well .
it didn &apos;t change its economy . it didn &apos;t change the compositions of its population .
so what is this bizarre architecture configuration that makes the network sing and be so unusual ?
you could see arguments on both sides .
and to this day , the page for Star Wars Kid has a warning right at the top that says you are not to put his real name on the page .
but then you hit this one . image removed at request of owner .
but , Japan , in contrast to India and China , maintained its national sovereignty .
the bubbles , not my bubbles , but the financial bubbles .
so I had another un@@ productive day .
so just imagine how many man-@@ months or man-@@ years are wasted , just like I wasted a day .
and it &apos;s serving 5@@ 2,000 villages , which represent about 80 million people .
and this is a new project I have with Dean Kamen , the famous inventor in America .
so the expansion slows down with time .
so we need something to be able to explain that .
now it turns out , in the mathematics , you can put it in as a term that &apos;s an energy , but it &apos;s a completely different type of energy from anything we &apos;ve ever seen before .
they just pass through anything .
and they &apos;d say , &quot; Well , because they want to survive . &quot;
and that is that we live in a competent universe , that we are part of a brilliant planet , and that we are surrounded by genius .
this is what I would tell you to remember if you ever forget this again .
and I could see why he thought , you know -- it was so beautifully done .
what &apos;s happening now , in this field called biomimicry , is that people are beginning to remember that organisms , other organisms , the rest of the natural world , are doing things very similar to what we need to do .
there is a company called Shar@@ k@@ let Techno@@ logies that &apos;s now putting this on the surfaces in hospitals to keep bacteria from landing , which is better than dou@@ sing it with anti-@@ bacter@@ ials or harsh cle@@ ans@@ ers that many , many organisms are now becoming drug resistant .
Emily O@@ ster flips our thinking on AIDS in Africa
and one part of that benefit is how much longer you think this program is going to be active .
this shows you -- in areas with low malaria , medium malaria , high malaria -- what happens to the number of sexual partners as you increase HIV prevalence .
that suggests it &apos;s pretty similar levels of development .
the epidemic was introduced to the US by actually one male steward on an airline flight , who got the disease in Africa and brought it back .
children don &apos;t choose a school .
this is what comes next .
but I joined the Indian Police Service , and then it was a new pattern of policing .
this is a project that we call reCAPTCHA , which is something that we started here at Carnegie Mellon , then we turned it into a startup company .
then what you &apos;re supposed to do is you take a screen shot of it .
but now with the Internet , I &apos;ve just shown you a project where we &apos;ve gotten 750 million people to help us digitize human knowledge .
so let me show you an example of something that was translated with a machine .
now when we were starting to think about this , we were blocked by these two things .
now the crazy thing about this method is that it actually really works .
so let me show you , this is our estimates of how fast we could translate Wikipedia from English into Spanish .
and we could do it in about 80 hours with a million active users .
this is totally biased towards the rich .
we haven &apos;t yet launched , but if you go there , you can sign up to be part of our private beta , which is probably going to start in about three or four weeks .
well , as with many other domains in life , I think the scientific method has the potential to answer this question .
Nope . as it turns out , people are less happy when they &apos;re mind-wandering no matter what they &apos;re doing . for example , people don &apos;t really like commuting to work very much .
I think it was a tactic of survival .
was what was happening in Ghana a metaphor for what was happening in me ?
they usually talk about the 17th century .
I know exactly how he did it ; I &apos;ve seen the drawings .
it &apos;s two fans , one which he could turn from outside after he got the vacuum established , and he discovered that if he pulled all the air out of it , the one fan would no longer turn the other one , right ?
it &apos;s not clear ; actually spar@@ klers will , but they didn &apos;t know that .
but -- all of us own stuff .
not a whole lot of people doing this stuff .
and once in a while , they would blow up .
I mean , you can &apos;t make up results , and then do another experiment based on that one .
one day , in the subway , I was snapping pictures of the tracks hoping to catch a rat or two , and a man came up to me and said , &quot; You can &apos;t take photographs here .
the remains of over six million people are housed in there , some over 1,300 years old .
and all these crystals here under the microscope were dead a few minutes ago , and they look alive .
and the key thing is to have lots of complex chemistry just bubbling away .
and I imagine you have a similar thing in cellular biology with the emergence of life .
so that means we could then start to develop different platforms for exploring this evolution .
yes , you can , and I &apos;ll show you in a second how to do that .
and when we gave them a battery , and a piece of wire , and a bulb , and said , &quot; Can you do it ? &quot; they couldn &apos;t do it . right ?
we got , later , the mosquito netting .
but even this is not a fair representation of Africa , because it &apos;s an average , it &apos;s an average speed of reduction in Africa .
Ghana got very ahead , fast .
Millennium Development Go@@ al rates for child mortality is fully possible .
how the heck could they be &#91; a &#93; developing country ?
what is the importance now with the relations here .
and those dreams are getting fulfilled .
and I like to show how it looks and how it works .
what &apos;s happening in the area of health ?
sorry . I can &apos;t spend more than 10 million dollars .
sorry , it doesn &apos;t work . you have to give it for 100 dollars , 200 dollars .
by young students from Stand@@ ford University on an extreme affordability project that they had , basically .
long-distance telephone service sold on price , price , price ; fast-food restaurants with all their value pricing ; and even the Internet is commodi@@ tizing not just goods , but services as well .
so , as long as we are in any sense authentic human beings , then every experience we have is authentic .
but Disney World is wonderfully true to itself .
now the easiest way to fall down in this , and not be real real , right , the easiest way not to be true to yourself is not to understand your heritage , and thereby repu@@ di@@ ate that heritage .
and what you have done in the past limits what you can do , what you can get away with , essentially , in the future .
think about any hotel , any airline , any hospital .
one of the fascinating things about what we were actually working on is that we were seeing , using new kinds of scanning technologies , things that had just never been seen before -- I mean , not only in disease management , but also things that allowed us to see things about the body that just made you marvel .
when I was a child , I started to explore motion .
and also , working with wire -- everything that I did was both a visual and a mechanical engineering decision at the same time .
so , I was able to sort of exercise all of that .
that &apos;s about that big .
now here , I &apos;m going to do a very poor job of silver sol@@ dering .
now , what we can do with the spectra ?
it &apos;s the only place where you can produce , actually , os@@ mi@@ um .
but it &apos;s to show you how complicated is the whole story of the production of chemical elements .
the Dop@@ pler Effect is used to discover extrasolar planets .
so where I started was with connection .
so very quickly -- really about six weeks into this research -- I ran into this unnamed thing that absolutely unra@@ veled connection in a way that I didn &apos;t understand or had never seen .
I call it a breakdown ; my therapist calls it a spiritual awakening .
my first meeting with her , Diana -- I brought in my list of the way the whole-hearted live , and I sat down .
and I said , &quot; Oh my God , this is going to suck . &quot;
I got up this morning at 6 : 10 a.m .
people were tracking their food via Twitter , their kids &apos; diapers on their iPhone .
now , we know that new tools are changing our sense of self in the world -- these tiny sensors that gather data in nature , the ubiquitous computing that allows that data to be understood and used , and of course the social networks that allow people to collaborate and contribute .
but we think of these tools as pointing outward , as windows and I &apos;d just like to invite you to think of them as also turning inward and becoming mirrors .
and even though Steven passed away three years ago we had an amazing journey as a family .
he renov@@ ated my carriage house when he was completely paralyzed , and unable to speak , and unable to breathe , and he won an award for a historic restoration .
his name is Mike , and he is uniformly impaired on cognition , vision , walking , sensation .
so , how can we take this and bring them a tool that they can go back and they can engage the medical system ?
I want to know now . can you help us ? &quot;
I bought a Mac about two years ago , I converted over , and I was so excited about this new feature of the time machine that came in Leop@@ ard . and we said -- because it &apos;s really cool , you can go back and you can look at the entire history of your computer , and find everything you &apos;ve lost , and I loved it .
so , remember I told you about my brother &apos;s stem cell transplant .
because something went different .
this is what the DIY and maker movements really look like .
I &apos;m biased .
so this isn &apos;t expensive pumps or valves .
and if you have children , you &apos;ve seen this hundreds of times before .
now if you fall below the average on this curve , then psychologists get thrilled , because that means you &apos;re either depressed or you have a disorder , or hopefully both .
see what we &apos;re finding is it &apos;s not necessarily the reality that shapes us , but the lens through which your brain views the world that shapes your reality .
here &apos;s how we get to health : we need to reverse the formula for happiness and success .
in the last three years , I &apos;ve traveled to 45 different countries , working with schools and companies in the midst of an economic downturn .
and if you are a boy , you &apos;re four times as likely to be diagnosed with ADHD -- At@@ tention De@@ fic@@ it Hyper@@ activity Disorder .
even in their older years , what we find is that there &apos;s still a problem .
it &apos;s coming from us .
we want our babies to read when they are six months old .
it &apos;s very uncomfortable to be on the receiving end of that kind of language .
designer John Maeda talks about his path from a Seattle tofu factory to the Rhode Island School of Design , where he became president in 2008 . Maeda , a ti@@ reless experimenter and a witty observer , explores the crucial moment when design met computers .
O.K. , so , everyone has a computer .
I can &apos;t tell you -- family business story : you &apos;d understand this -- my father was the most sincere man possible .
I went to MIT , did my math , but I had this wonderful opportunity , because computers had just become visual .
I made a desktop publishing system way back when , and that was , kind of , my first step into figuring out how to -- oh , these two sides are kind of fun to mix .
and then luckily , you know , I had the fortune of going to something called a library , and in the library I came upon this very book .
and so I began to sort of mess with the computer at the time .
now , I was saying , Well , that &apos;s the whole point : it &apos;s moving .
it didn &apos;t make any sense .
I made -- I took my old Macint@@ os@@ hes and made different objects out of them from Tokyo .
I &apos;ve done shoes for Re@@ e@@ bo@@ k as well , as a kind of a hobby for appar@@ el .
and I also discovered how .
and I went after it with passion .
we &apos;ve wanted to do this for about a hundred years .
and it works .
a sport pilot can be certific@@ ated in as little as 20 hours of flight time .
now what is the hedon@@ ic opportunity cost on spending six billion pounds on those railway tracks ?
but so much communication now is contextual that the capacity for actually nu@@ dging people , for giving them better information -- B@@ .@@ J. Fo@@ gg , at the University of Stanford , makes the point that actually the mobile phone is -- He &apos;s invented the phrase , &quot; persuasive technologies . &quot;
woman : weren &apos;t they square ?
which isn &apos;t a bad definition of what our job is , to help people appreciate what is unfamiliar , but also to gain a greater appreciation , and place a far higher value on those things which are already existing .
we humans are Earth &apos;s Pand@@ or@@ an species .
he had no concept of the idea of an algorithm , but that &apos;s what he described in that book , and this is what we now know as the evolutionary algorithm .
audience : must .
information that we copy from person to person , by imitation , by language , by talking , by telling stories , by wearing clothes , by doing things .
this is design process going on .
And@@ re told me , after seeing these buildings fail again and again in the same way , that there is no new research here .
for the billions spent on reconstruction , you can train masons for dollars on every house that they end up building over their lifetime .
so , now we had a student -- an acting student -- that was a part of the group .
so , what have we learned from this about cheating ?
then - Will I keep going ?
such is the power of self-@@ study .
it is nothing more than a trivial logic gate with four in@@ pu@@ t-@@ output states .
before I left , I actually asked him if I could get him something .
Joyce &apos;s mother is now taking care of her daughter , like so many other Zimbab@@ wean children who &apos;ve been orphaned by the epidemic .
it &apos;s between two isotopes of hydrogen , two kinds of hydrogen : de@@ uter@@ ium , which is heavy hydrogen , which you can get from seawater , and tritium which is super-@@ heavy hydrogen .
we &apos;ve got to take that , we &apos;ve got to make that into a fusion reactor .
but this is what we &apos;re aiming at , sometime in the 20@@ 30s -- real electric power from fusion . thank you very much .
they pay a middle-@@ man thousands of dollars to be there .
currently , right now , thousands of workers are abandoned .
and how many times would my self have to die before I realized that it was never alive in the first place ?
so in Africa , there &apos;s been more time to create genetic diversity . &quot;
but what was credible , what is biological and scientific fact , is that we all stem from Africa -- in fact , from a woman called Mit@@ ochondri@@ al Eve who lived 16@@ 0,000 years ago .
in those moments , I &apos;m connected to everything -- the ground , the air , the sounds , the energy from the audience .
so that &apos;s it spe@@ eded up .
but the key part is trying to give back an extraordinary piece of landscape , rather than engulf it .
since we have an extra minute here , I thought perhaps you could tell us a little bit about these seeds , which maybe came from the shaved bit of the building .
and also , for me , biking is a matter of empowerment .
so these are words like &quot; teamwork &quot; or &quot; endurance &quot; or even complicated concepts like &quot; resource allocation &quot; or &quot; perspective , &quot; a word that they don &apos;t understand .
and at the end of each ride , we sit together and share moments in which those special words of the day popped up and made a difference , and these discussions can be extremely inspiring .
we visit Ki@@ b@@ but@@ z@@ im that were established by Holocaust survivors .
now , these aren &apos;t just differences in anatomy , like the shape of your ear lobes , but they have consequences in thought and behavior that are well illustrated in this famous cartoon by Charles Add@@ ams : &quot; separated at birth , the Malli@@ fer@@ t twins meet accidentally . &quot;
none of the dire professional consequences has taken place -- I haven &apos;t been exiled from the city of Cambridge .
well , this turned out to be probably the most controversial claim in the book .
we can &apos;t do this . &quot;
because , look , I &apos;m not a social anthropologist but I have a friend who is .
meanwhile , we &apos;ve got two trillion dollars -- at a minimum , according to the American Society of Civil Engin@@ eers -- that we need to exp@@ end to even make a dent in the infrastructure , which is currently rated at a D minus .
they &apos;re two sides of the same coin , just like innovation and imitation , like risk and responsibility , like peripetia and anagnorisis , like that poor little lamb , who I hope isn &apos;t quivering anymore , and like my time that &apos;s gone .
so I was leaf@@ ing through it , wondering if I had any mental disorders , and it turns out I &apos;ve got 12 .
and he said , &quot; Yes , we can prove it to you . &quot;
and we got to Broadmoor .
and Brian the Sciento@@ logist whispered to me , &quot; They &apos;re medic@@ ated , &quot; which to the Sciento@@ logists is like the worst evil in the world , but I &apos;m thinking it &apos;s probably a good idea .
and in fact , faking madness is exactly the kind of cunning and manipulative act of a psychopath .
you want to go and interview yourself some corporate psychopaths . &quot;
he was taking me through the garden .
for instance , one famous story about him , somebody came up to him and said , &quot; I &apos;ve just bought myself a new car . &quot;
it &apos;s like Star Trek . you &apos;re going where no man has gone before . &quot;
and we leave the normal stuff on the floor .
some people say that democracy consists basically in elections .
now , if Islam and democracy are at present in a moment of great confrontation , what does that mean ?
I was a penguin aqu@@ arist at the New England Aquarium .
the first penguins to make that transition to free feeding were the ones that had a metal band on their wing from the Apollo Sea spill six years earlier .
so he raced to the lab and made enough to clean the rest of the birds .
well , you should care because they &apos;re an indicator species .
they said , &quot; Absolu@@ tely fine , provided you get planning permission and you do it in Latin and you do it in tri@@ plic@@ ate , &quot; so we did - - and now there are fruit trees and bushes and herbs and vegetables around that doctor &apos;s surgery .
it &apos;s about taking those artistic people in your community and doing some fabulous designs in those raised beds to explain to people what &apos;s growing there , because there &apos;s so many people that don &apos;t really recognize a vegetable unless it &apos;s in a bit of plastic with a bit of an instruction packet on the top .
and for those people that don &apos;t want to do either of those things , maybe they can cook , so we pick them seas@@ onally and then we go on the street , or in the pub , or in the church , or wherever people are living their lives .
really popular . people congre@@ gated around it .
sales were up .
but it is joined up , and it is inclusive .
and for 13 years I kept clear of it . I wanted to be an English literature professor .
between 19@@ 14 and 1945 , 70 million people died in Europe alone as a result of armed conflict .
and these -- whatever our wretched beliefs -- is a religious matter , it &apos;s a spiritual matter .
it &apos;s of great importance that the word for &quot; holy &quot; in Hebrew , applied to God , is &quot; K@@ ad@@ osh &quot; : separate , other .
we need to create a movement among all these people that I meet in my travels -- you probably meet , too -- who want to join up , in some way , and reclaim their faith , which they feel , as I say , has been hijacked .
and that &apos;s fel@@ ony murder -- 25 to life , par@@ ole at 50 if you &apos;re lucky , and Tony &apos;s not feeling very lucky .
so I say to Tony , &quot; Sor@@ ry , but it &apos;s worse than you think .
maybe it &apos;s you , maybe it &apos;s me -- but we &apos;re not here to trade opinions ; everyone &apos;s got an opinion .
and in a pointless universe , that , to me , is a wonderful thing .
Eve Ensler on security
and through their work over the last years , this is not only happening that this house is opening , but it &apos;s being supported by many factions of the society who never would have supported it .
all of us are refugees .
I do not use them as weapons .
we &apos;re in the middle of the process .
but if you think about it , from my head to my hands to his leg .
but when you do , you don &apos;t get what you expect .
and the guy behind the counter said , &quot; I know , lady . they all came in that way . &quot;
every time we make irrational demands , exhibit irresponsible behavior or display any other signs of being normal American citizens , we are called childish .
now , the resident artist said they got some of their best ideas through the program because kids don &apos;t think about the limitations of how hard it can be to blow glass into certain shapes ; they just think of good ideas .
I wrote over 300 short stories on that little laptop , and I wanted to get published .
are you ready to make the match ?
to play a game in those days you had to have an imagination to believe that you were really playing &quot; B@@ att@@ le@@ star Gal@@ ac@@ tica . &quot;
so 37 is our target audience .
and once we get enough of those guys , we &apos;re going to want more fantasy artists that can create places we &apos;ve never been to before , or characters that we &apos;ve just never seen before .
I have fought in wars , feared for my own survival , watched my co@@ hor@@ ts die on beaches and woods that look and feel more real than any textbook or any news story .
so P@@ uck meant not only are we fools in the pe@@ j@@ or@@ ative sense , but that we &apos;re easily fooled . in fact , what Shakespeare was pointing out is we go to the theater in order to be fooled , so we &apos;re actually looking forward to it .
those three things give rise to all the different levels of what seem to be complexity in our world .
now she had them look at them and do this ... labori@@ ous , which I thought for a long time , until she explained to me was to slow them down so they &apos;ll think .
and so what we can do is we can lay out the frames side by side or stack them up .
so you can &apos;t tell much from just making the ball drop there , but if we drop the ball and run the movie at the same time , we can see that we have come up with an accurate physical model .
and we &apos;re going to have to come to grips with the fact that there are differences between us as individuals that we will know about , and between sub@@ populations of humans as well .
it would change absolutely everything .
are you going to be able to resist that if it doesn &apos;t have any overt side effects ?
we try and use our technology to improve our lives in one way or another .
it &apos;s how we look at it .
so we &apos;re driving home and she &apos;s looking out the window , and she goes , &quot; Mom . what if two just people saw each other on the street , like a man and a woman , they just started doing it . would that ever happen ? &quot;
even trips to the dentist require that you take antibiotics , in case you get an internal infection on the valve .
well the answer to that is a multidisciplinary team .
jargon is a big one .
and then we realized that it was actually a mirror image of the real aorta .
yeah .
and then , of course , they were used by extremists and politicians on the other side .
so you see the style is different .
our planet is a good planet because it can keep water .
it was all a mistake ; it should have never happened . but it did .
this whole Ga@@ ia idea , that life makes the world better for itself -- anybody been on a freeway on a Friday afternoon in Los Angeles believing in the Ga@@ ia theory ? no .
but the thing about this is that every once in a while we divers can run into trouble , so I &apos;m going to do a little thought experiment here .
a no-brainer .
we &apos;ll apply that throughout our global supply chain regardless of ownership or control .
the problem is the lack of trust , the lack of confidence , the lack of partnership between NGOs , campaign groups , civil society organizations and multinational companies .
they didn &apos;t say money .
and fourth , someone has something you thought you knew everything about , but they &apos;re introducing a new angle of looking at it .
this man was in an NGO feeding center , being helped as much as he could be helped .
this time , maybe confused or discoura@@ ged by the military disaster in Somalia , the international community remained silent , and somewhere around 800,000 people were slaughtered by their own country@@ men -- sometimes their own neighbors -- using farm implements as weapons .
one day in rehab someone , started talking about surfing and all these guys who &apos;d never sur@@ fed before said , &quot; Hey , let &apos;s go . &quot;
and the color now is the majority religion .
but 30 years from now , Afghanistan will go from 30 million to 60 million .
I went to the statistical authority of Qatar , to their webpage -- It &apos;s a very good webpage . I recommend it -- and I looked up -- oh yeah , you can have lots of fun here -- and provided free of charge , I found Qatar &apos;s social trends .
most of us have to trust that that happens correctly for our own vote , and we all have to trust that that happens correctly for all the votes in the election .
and you shred the candidate list .
I was on the bus . my wife and I , of 37 years , joined the bus .
by day nine , you look at this picture , and you &apos;re horrified .
and David Hey@@ mann , who &apos;s watching this on the web@@ cast -- David , keep on going . we &apos;re close . we &apos;re down to four countries .
the polio surveillance program is four million people going door to door .
instead of finding out what we thought was the case -- that blindness was caused mostly by gl@@ au@@ coma and trachoma -- we were ast@@ ounded to find out that blindness was caused instead by catar@@ act .
blindness , polio -- early detection , early response .
I have two primary personalities that have been in conflict and conversation within me since I was a little girl .
now on paper , she passed my smoking ears test .
I found this photography of mine almost compulsive .
and over there I experienced other people &apos;s suffering , up close and personal , immersed myself in some rather intense and emotional stories , and at times I experienced great fear for my own life .
as always , I would return to Bangalore , and often to animated discussions at friend &apos;s homes , where we would discuss various issues while they complained bit@@ terly about the new pub ti@@ mings , where a drink often cost more than what they &apos;d paid their 14-year-old maid .
CA : Wow , so your leak really substantially changed the world ?
keep shoot &apos; n . keep shoot &apos; n .
actually , they &apos;re not . my son isn &apos;t . how dare you ? &quot;
so it &apos;s not going to change their opinion . it &apos;s not going to change their perception .
well , we just show the website instead , for all that time , as a f@@ iller , and we became very famous in Iceland , went to Iceland and spoke about this issue .
my translation medium is a very simple basket .
you place it in an art museum , it becomes a sculpture .
so my idea was born , and I had the project set up and a hypothesis , so what was my next step ?
so for the past few years , the coastal areas , they found themselves in a shortage of labor .
190@@ 6 . this man , John Philip Sousa , traveled to this place , the United States Capitol , to talk about this technology , what he called the , quote , &quot; talking machines . &quot;
never before has creativity of the millions been as effectively displaced , and displaced because of these , quote , &quot; infer@@ nal machines . &quot;
common sense , a rare idea in the law , but here it was . common sense -- -- R@@ evol@@ ts at the idea . common sense .
it is a literacy for this generation . this is how our kids speak .
it failed partly because the courts are too passive , partly because the legisl@@ atures are corrupted , by which I don &apos;t mean that there &apos;s bribery operating to stop real change , but more the economy of influence that governs how Congress functions means that policymakers here will not understand this until it &apos;s too late to fix it .
and the solution here , in my view , is a private solution , a solution that looks to leg@@ alize what it is to be young again , and to realize the economic potential of that , and that &apos;s where the story of BMI becomes relevant .
next line of code : make a stem .
how &apos;s this stuff work ? if each of you differs from the person next to you by one in a thousand , but only three percent codes , which means it &apos;s only one in a thousand times three percent , very small differences in expression and punctu@@ ation can make a significant difference . take a simple declar@@ ative sentence .
it won &apos;t do anything for you .
it really matters if you &apos;re literate , not just in reading and writing in English and French and German , but in Microsoft and Linux and Apple .
India and China used to be 40 percent of the global economy just at the Industrial Revolution , and they are now about 4.@@ 8 percent .
in the 1990s , these are sovereign states that did not exist before 1990 .
so sorry . &quot;
here &apos;s Koko with her kit@@ ten .
well babies will fake a cry , pause , wait to see who &apos;s coming and then go right back to crying .
and then we &apos;re going to look at the hot spots and see if we can find them ourselves .
they &apos;ll alter their vocal tone , often making their vocal tone much lower .
but I know she looked at you with those amazing brown eyes , and you still wanted to kill her .
it &apos;s a much more noisy world .
you start up that path of being just a little bit more explicit , because you signal to everyone around you , you say , &quot; Hey , my world , our world , it &apos;s going to be an honest one .
giraffes are this desire in the dark . &quot;
well , it &apos;s just a joke , anyway .
but Harry &apos;s wife is confused , because she said , &quot; You know , Harry had been packing his own lunch for 20 years . &quot;
a Pakistani Muslim teaching Jewish Holocaust history to young Igbo children .
it &apos;s called &quot; O@@ de to the D@@ rum , &quot; and I &apos;ll try and read it the way Y@@ use@@ f would be proud to hear it read .

a little , tiny guy walks along . more serv@@ o drives , lots of serv@@ o hacking , lots of mechanical stuff .
I try to do a lot of philosophy , a lot of thinking about all of these projects .
and I just a little bit on each one .
so I kind of retired , and we &apos;re already living in paradise up in Bo@@ ise , on a river , you know . so and then I started another company called To@@ y Innovation and we did some projects with Mat@@ tel with actually with a lady who &apos;s here , Ivy Ross , and we did Mir@@ acle Mo@@ ves Baby , made it in Wired magazine , did a bunch of other stuff .
if I do it kind of right , it might move kind of like the real thing .
and about this time , you know , all these other people are starting to help .
and you -- more you have them , kind of the older they get , and they kind of learn through their behavior .
you , yeah , yeah . okay , he &apos;s hungry .
I &apos;ll show you what he &apos;s been doing for , for four years .
and we think we can help that out by having little creatures that you can love .
and they don &apos;t just guess what makes people happy ; they go to places like Latin America and they realize that happiness there is associated with family life .
but there &apos;s a solution : you build a toilet .
luckily , the genetic testing proved that , in fact , this strand came north , because , had it come from the south , it would have had a much wider impact in terms of transmission .
when we went to pristine reefs , we realized that the natural world was upside down ; this pyramid was inverted .
well , what we have seen is that in this particular area during El Nino , year &apos; 97 , &apos; 98 , the water was too warm for too long , and many corals bleached and many died .
this is very substantial .
which takes us to the third reason , why we don &apos;t have many more reserves , is that the funding models have been wrong .
second , we need to redesign our governance so conservation efforts can be decentralized , so conservation efforts don &apos;t depend on work from NGOs or from government agencies and can be created by the local communities , like it happens in the Philippines and a few other places .
Enric Sala : thank you .
a lot of the experience of people here who &apos;ve been in the oceans for a long time has just been seeing this degradation , the places they saw that were beautiful getting worse , depressing .
these are the kids who now , one semester in , I can put something on the board , totally new , totally foreign , and they &apos;ll have a conversation about it for three or four minutes more than they would have at the start of the year , which is just so fun .
these are called tube worms .

these people work with the Chinese restaurant model -- same principles , different applications and different settings -- not the McDonald &apos;s model .
you need efforts to supplement schools .
think about that .
I &apos;m going to become a cro@@ t@@ che@@ ty old lady .
and here &apos;s an example of what I mean .
and so I went back and I studied my first two acts , trying to see who I was then , who I really was -- not who my parents or other people told me I was , or treated me like I was .
but who was I ? who were my parents -- not as parents , but as people ?
and he wrote that , while he was in the camp , he could tell , should they ever be released , which of the people would be okay and which would not .
you can take cuttings ; they can sort of have sex with themselves ; they can pollinate themselves .
and that &apos;s actually rather useful for for@@ ens@@ ics and so on .
this orchid , known as Darwin &apos;s orchid , because it &apos;s one that he studied and made a wonderful prediction when he saw it -- you can see that there &apos;s a very long nectar tube that descends down from the orchid .

and little did I know , that you should listen to eight year-olds .
there is a real problem with snobbery .
now , the opposite of a snob is your mother .
it &apos;s a beautiful idea . the problem is if you really believe in a society where those who merit to get to the top , get to the top , you &apos;ll also , by implication , and in a far more nasty way , believe in a society where those who deserve to get to the bottom also get to the bottom and stay there .
and if you open the newspaper any day of the week , it &apos;s full of people who &apos;ve messed up their lives .
at the other end of the spectrum you &apos;ve got tragedy and tragic art , and I suppose I &apos;m arguing that we should learn a little bit about what &apos;s happening in tragic art .
you can &apos;t be successful at everything .
these are hugely powerful forces that define what we want and how we view ourselves .
we can give glucose a sensor for diabetes to prevent it .
and so maybe if we lived 200 years , we could accumulate enough skills and knowledge to solve some problems .
and whatever you do , don &apos;t read anything about genetics that &apos;s published within your lifetime , or something .
saying , not what are the situations , but what are the kinds of problems and what are the kinds of strategies , how do you learn them , how do you connect them up , how does a really creative person invent a new way of thinking out of the available resources and so forth .
it turned out he was hired by a Scottish distil@@ l@@ ery to understand why they were burning so damn much peat to distill the whiskey .

because I also , I &apos;m going to admit to you , I also thought , &quot; How can I be like a hot-@@ shot young full professor who teaches human rights and not know this ?
it &apos;s a pretty harrowing lin@@ kage between what &apos;s happening to our environment and what &apos;s happening to our human rights .
D : Michael , what &apos;s your take on the people story ? are you interested ?
this is not James , this is one of the kids that he works with .
dumped without political participation , decent education , any kind of real opportunity in terms of economic lives , and then sentenced to generations of violence and prejudice and discrimination .

Ed : and then Embassy Row is actually a historical site , because in the Kymaer@@ ican story this is where the Pari@@ sian Diaspora started , where there embassy was .
but what is really cool is that we take our visual environment as inevitable . and it &apos;s not .
so let &apos;s watch that . nobody &apos;s ever seen it .

this is a completely different example .
and there &apos;s this famous example of one that was 1,200 feet long and lasted for two days , and the ants just kept marching around and around in a circle until they died .
and we &apos;re doing the same thing we did for -- more or less , that we &apos;ve done since the Civil War , a stick and a hook .
you think it &apos;s bad to lose one arm ?

but beyond our compassion , and far greater than compassion , is our moral imagination and our identification with each individual who lives in that world , not to think of them as a huge forest , but as individual trees .
now you may reason that we have one to perceive the world or to think , and that &apos;s completely wrong .
we have no idea what is going on inside her brain when she does that , and that &apos;s what we &apos;d like to know .
and here &apos;s inside the brain .
so as I go around the world , I &apos;m making predictions of what I should get , subtracting them off .
you will know what this person is doing , whether happy , sad , old , young -- a huge amount of information .
so what is it about a movement which is good or bad ?
so you &apos;re a movement -- -- chau@@ vin@@ ist .
the fact that we forget most of our childhood , for example , is probably fine , because it doesn &apos;t effect our movements later in life .
the most intriguing and puzzling measurement , in my opinion , we &apos;ve obtained of Mars , was released earlier this year in the magazine Science .
we now have evidence that methane is in the atmosphere of Mars , a gas that , on Earth , is bio@@ genic in origin , produced by living systems .
the oldest rock on Earth is only 3.6 billion .
and we spent two days deciding how to best answer this question .
we are prepared to fly this on Mars , rewrite the textbook about Mars .
there are fewer and fewer people who are still available that you might infect , and then you get the pl@@ ateau of the curve , and you get this classic sigmoidal curve .
and the lines represent -- the dots are the people , and the lines represent friendship relationships .
and we tested this idea with an outbreak of H1N1 flu at Harvard College in the fall and winter of 2009 , just a few months ago .
and that , as indicated by the white line , occurred 46 days before the peak of the epidemic .
and if you look at this image -- here we are now in September the 13th -- you &apos;re going to see a few cases light up .
now , as I &apos;ve been suggesting , this method is not restricted to germs , but actually to anything that spreads in populations .
or we can monitor doctors prescri@@ bing behaviors , passively , and see how the diffusion of innovation with pharmaceuticals occurs within &#91; networks of &#93; doctors .

and the dad used to use those bulls to tell the boy stories about that civilization and their work .
I spent the better part of a decade looking at American responses to mass atro@@ city and genocide .
why no hear@@ ings , no den@@ unci@@ ations , no people getting arrested in front of the Rwandan embassy or in front of the White House ? what &apos;s the deal ?
and that &apos;s what that moment with Patricia Schro@@ eder I think shows : that if we are to bring about an end to the world &apos;s worst atrocities , we have to make it such .
to call it a movement , as with all movements , perhaps , is a little misleading .
they have launched a di@@ vestment campaign that has now convinced , I think , 55 universities in 22 states to di@@ vest their hol@@ dings of stocks with regard to companies doing business in Sudan .
they &apos;ve lowered the transaction costs of stopping genocide .
he was Bobby Kenne@@ dy-@@ like because in some ways one could never tell if he was a realist ma@@ squ@@ erad@@ ing as an ide@@ alist or an ide@@ alist ma@@ squ@@ erad@@ ing as a realist , as people always wondered about Bobby Kennedy and John Kennedy in that way .
he was in Mozambique for the War of Independence .
and it doesn &apos;t have to be an act of weakness .
and I recognize there is so much to be afraid of .
and I thought , there &apos;s nothing more haunting than the cry of a child that cannot be returned with food -- the most fundamental expectation of every human being .
in fact , what we know now is that every 10 seconds we lose a child to hunger .
well first , I &apos;d like to talk about the oldest nutritional method on Earth , breastfeeding .
it doesn &apos;t need to be refrigerated , it doesn &apos;t need water , which is often lacking .
absolutely not .
perhaps most exciting to me is an idea that Bill Gates , Howard Buffett and others have supported boldly , which is to ask the question : what if , instead of looking at the hungry as victims -- and most of them are small farmers who cannot raise enough food or sell food to even support their own families -- what if we view them as the solution , as the value chain to fight hunger ?
it is transforming the face of hunger in Brazil , and it &apos;s at scale , and it &apos;s creating opportunities .
we have to stand together .
and I would like you to join with all of humanity to draw a line in the sand and say , &quot; No more .
for the last 50 years , we have focused on treating the individual gene in understanding cancer , not in controlling cancer .
what &apos;s exciting is that over the last two or three years , the government has spent 400 million dollars , and they &apos;ve allocated another billion dollars , to what we call the Cancer Genome Atlas Project .
so the morning the FDA was going to meet , this was the editorial in the Wall Street Journal .
and I think one of the exciting things that is starting to happen now is that people from those fields are coming in .
we need a radically different approach .
natural sound can do that too .
so , ask yourself : is this person ever going to drive at a steady 28 miles per hour ? I don &apos;t think so .

these devices beat back and forth about 200 hertz during flight , and the animal can use them to sense its body rotation and initiate very , very fast corrective maneuvers .
yes , the inequality goes in this direction , or I would pos@@ it it .
and they &apos;re not concepts that I &apos;ve come up with , but concepts that have been proposed by others in the past .
and one idea comes from lessons from chewing crabs .
but non-@@ spiking neurons are actually quite complicated because they can have input synapses and output synapses all inter@@ digit@@ ated , and there &apos;s no single action potential that drives all the outputs at the same time .
the reason why the moon is huge on the horizon is simply because our perceptual bubble does not stretch out 3@@ 80,000 kilometers .
so , the Holy Grail for neuroscience is really to understand the design of the neo@@ cor@@ i@@ tical column -- and it &apos;s not just for neuroscience ; it &apos;s perhaps to understand perception , to understand reality , and perhaps to even also understand physical reality .
since then , I &apos;ve used about 30 kinds of submarines and I &apos;ve started three companies and a nonprofit foundation called Deep Search to design and build systems to access the deep sea .

and when Watson and Crick in the &apos; 50s first deco@@ ded this beautiful double helix that we know as the DNA molecule -- very long , complicated molecule -- we then started on this journey to understand that inside of that DNA is a language that determines the characteristics , our traits , what we inherit , what diseases we may get .

I mean , who in their right mind would think that a dog would want to approach them when they &apos;re screaming like that ?
I was walking onto a plane -- this , for me , was a pivotal moment in my career , and it really cem@@ ented what I wanted to do with this whole pu@@ pp@@ y-@@ training thing , the notion of how to teach puppies in a dog-@@ friendly way to want to do what we want to do , so we don &apos;t have to force them .
these relationship skills are so easy .
this is it at night -- sorry , from a distance .
now , this area floods three to four times a year , and there &apos;s a le@@ ve@@ e behind our site similar to the ones that broke in New Orleans .
so our strategy was very simple .
I hope that I &apos;ve given you the desire to learn to see the world with new eyes .
the acid rain was falling on the forests .
I &apos;ve tried to work out which is bigger , and it &apos;s almost impossible .
in our species , we don &apos;t like doing that .
and basically we experimentally inocul@@ ate people with the common cold virus .
no one would even consider it , because no one had a clue that it could cause respiratory failure .
what is that ? it &apos;s an antiviral defense enzyme .
and you actually start this game in a drop of water , as a very , very small single-@@ cell creature , and right off the bat you basically just have to live , survive , reproduce .
now , we actually play through many generations here , at the cellular scale .
I &apos;m going to skip ahead here . at some point we get larger , and we actually get to a macro-@@ evolution scale .
one thing we noticed with &quot; The Sim@@ s , &quot; which is a game I did earlier , is that players love making stuff .
when they were able to make stuff in the game they had a tremendous amount of empathy in connection to it . even if it wasn &apos;t as pretty as what other people would make it -- as a professional artist would make for games -- it really stuck with them and they really cared about what would happen to it .
now again , the empathy that the players have when they create the content is tremendous . now , when players create content in this game , it &apos;s automatically sent up to a server and then re@@ distributed to all the other players transparently .
I &apos;m going to skip way ahead here to the space phase .
now , at this point we &apos;re actually dealing with a very little toy planet .
almost , again , like the Montessori toy idea .
you know , what happens if you give somebody a toy planet , and let them play with a lot of dynamics on it , what could they discover ? what might they learn on this ?
so I can come in and I can do things , and just treat this planet as a lump of clay .
and not only that , but also show the dynamics , and a lot of the interesting objects that you might find , maybe like in the Hubble , at pretty much realistic frequencies and scales .
body language affects how others see us , but it may also change how we see ourselves . social psychologist Amy Cu@@ ddy shows how &quot; power posing &quot; -- standing in a posture of confidence , even when we don &apos;t feel confident -- can affect testosterone and cortisol levels in the brain , and might even have an impact on our chances for success .
so the second question really was , you know , so we know that our minds change our bodies , but is it also true that our bodies change our minds ?
they actually feel that they &apos;re going to win even at games of chance .
physi@@ ologically , there also are differences on two key hormones : testosterone , which is the dominance hormone , and cortisol , which is the stress hormone .
but what &apos;s driving it ? it &apos;s not about the content of the speech .
it &apos;s about the presence that they &apos;re bringing to the speech .
many people have laid down their lives for communism , and many have laid down their lives for capitalism .
and I agree . it is largely wonderful . largely wonderful .
the piece was sung entirely in X@@ hos@@ a , which is a beautifully musical language , if you don &apos;t know it .
we &apos;re going to sing those three wonderful notes : T , E , D .
C@@ H : I only wish that some of those musicians were here with us today , so you could see at firsthand how utterly extraordinary they are .
we drove to the Good@@ will and we threw the sweater away somewhat cerem@@ oni@@ ously , my idea being that I would never have to think about the sweater nor see it ever again .
they gave it back to the wise old woman .
that &apos;s the question .
because , the thing is , when we &apos;re involved in conflict , it &apos;s very easy to lose perspective .
stories matter . as an anthropologist , I know that .
let &apos;s see if we can apply the third side to it .
that &apos;s why in negotiations , often , when things get tough , people go for walks in the woods .
but that &apos;s what you discover , is you go into these villages in the Middle East where you expect hostility , and you get the most amazing hospitality , all associated with Abraham .
it brought us hope .
the potential is basically to change the game .
well , the doctor can program a level of this ST elevation voltage that will trigger an emergency alarm , vibration like your cell phone , but right by your cla@@ vic@@ le bone .

and in about 30 days we &apos;ll know for sure whether this works .
so , in the same way that you wake up , take a shower and get dressed , you have to learn to do that for your digital self .
so if you look at gray matter volume , for example , gray matter volume across age from age four to 22 years increases during childhood , which is what you can see on this graph . it peaks in early adolescence .
there are three trucks there . you &apos;re going to instinctively go for the white truck , because that &apos;s the top truck from your perspective , but then you have to remember , &quot; Oh , he can &apos;t see that truck , so he must mean me to move the blue truck , &quot; which is the top truck from his perspective . now believe it or not , normal , healthy , intelligent adults like you make errors about 50 percent of the time on that kind of trial .
okay , so if I just show you the percentage errors in a large developmental study we did , this is in a study ranging from age seven to adulthood , and what you &apos;re going to see is the percentage errors in the adult group in both conditions , so the gray is the director condition , and you see that our intelligent adults are making errors about 50 percent of the time , whereas they make far fewer errors when there &apos;s no director present , when they just have to remember that rule of ignoring the gray background .
and people are initially reluctant to tell you .
well , back in 2001 , when there was just a simple test and a single dose of a drug , a nurse , in the course of her few minutes with a patient , would have to counsel for the HIV test , perform the HIV test , explain the results , dispense a single dose of the drug , Ne@@ vir@@ ap@@ ine , explain how to take it , discuss infant feeding options , reinforce infant feeding , and test the baby -- in minutes .
and so we need to find better ways of providing care .
these mothers , we call them mentor mothers , are able to engage women who , just like themselves , pregnant with babies , have found out about being HIV-positive , who need support and education .
so , a couple years ago , one of the mentor mothers came back , and she told me a story .
and our organization helps women across that bridge .
did you know rats that ate genetically engineered corn had developed signs of liver and kidney toxicity ?
I want you to know that me , my brother and sister actually like eating baked k@@ ale chips .
not too long ago , my uncle said that he offered my six-year-old cousin cereal .
and then this is books sold -- the logarithmic scale .
but the thing that I &apos;m really , really excited about is this incredible granola house .
but I was in for the adventure .
there &apos;s actually more mountains in the ocean than there are on land .
they &apos;re very low to the water , and they &apos;re all uninhabited , except one island has about 35 caretakers on it .
he stopped , and he said , &quot; Yes , we would like to do that to deal with our overfishing problem , and I think we would call it a reverse fishing license . &quot;
he said , &quot; Greg , there &apos;s two things I &apos;d like you to do .
so there are , of course , two different possibilities .
and their inaug@@ ural exhibit was called &quot; Happiness . &quot;
this is a campaign done by a young artist in New York , who calls himself &quot; Tru@@ e . &quot;
he &apos;s from Korea originally .
I think the reason this works so well is because everybody involved wins .
and the whole thing just fell together .
then it &apos;s : &quot; guts . &quot;
the first is the fall of Gran@@ ada , the last Muslim enc@@ la@@ ve in Europe .
I got accused in a few blogs that I was actually sent by the Pope to preach the Trin@@ ity and Catho@@ li@@ ci@@ sm in the Middle East , so you -- you believe who you want . I gave you my version of the story .
&quot; so when &apos;s the article coming out ? &quot;
so fl@@ ur@@ ry of phone calls and emails from The New York Times .
I don &apos;t deserve it . I don &apos;t deserve anything .
and I asked the students in Kuwait where they thought these incidents took place .
so we could say , well , a new figure comes out ... let &apos;s see African debt .
data is the kind of ubiquitous resource that we can shape to provide new innovations and new insights , and it &apos;s all around us , and it can be mined very easily .
but I wanted to convey something to you .
there &apos;s something almost quite magical about visual information .
now , you can see Africa &apos;s total debt there and the U.K. budget deficit for reference .
that changes the picture considerably .
who has the most soldiers ? it &apos;s got to be China .
except here it &apos;s been split up in parts by Est@@ é@@ e Lau@@ der and by the perfum@@ er who did it , Cal@@ ice Bec@@ ker , and I &apos;m most grateful to them for this .
and the other theory is that we smell molecular vibrations .
this is -- in other words , we never get the O-@@ H -- we never mistake it for an S-H , OK ?
if it didn &apos;t , the whole idea was toast , and I might as well move on to other things .
and I said , well , by whom ? I mean most , you know -- there &apos;s three attitudes : you &apos;re right , and I don &apos;t know why , which is the most rational one at this point .
my focus is understanding you people , and how you interact with the government to get your benefits , how you interact with corporations to decide whom you &apos;re going to do business with , and how you view brands .
so , how are we going to change the world ?
it was the primary purpose of the social worker , the aim , to get the woman at her most vulnerable time in her entire life , to sign the adoption papers .
if you were black , it was a summer of hate .
why do they do that ? why do old ladies go to those hair shops , and make those helmets ?
youth can never come again ; We have drunk the summer wine .
I hope you know that now .
which is America &apos;s Jupiter ?
a sorcer@@ er &apos;s profit on Wall Street ?
cloning will transform everything . voice navigation will transform everything .
my shame as a sp@@ ur , I fled the abyss .
and one day , a couple of weeks later , it might have been maybe a year later , I was in the art store with my kids , and I was buying some clay tools -- we were going to have a craft day .
and this is , after some acid etching , the one that I ended up with .
we are one species of about five and a half thousand mammalian species that exist on planet Earth today .
but this voice kept calling me : &quot; come on , stay with me . &quot;
but before I left the hospital , the head nurse had said to me , &quot; Janine , I want you to be ready , because when you get home , something &apos;s going to happen . &quot;
I did get depressed .
and I wondered how had she ever found that level of acceptance .
and then I got my commercial pilot &apos;s license .
like those big explosions , sparks , are from a little comb jelly , and there &apos;s krill and other kinds of crustaceans , and jellyfish .
and then when it &apos;s not using it , it actually can roll it down into its head just like the headlights on your Lam@@ bor@@ gh@@ ini .
it makes the product strong , the tes@@ sel@@ lation .
what nature does is it drills holes in things . it liber@@ ates form .
I &apos;ll tell you about that later .
it &apos;s for a company called Mor@@ oso in Italy .
I have a big show with Phillips A@@ uc@@ tion@@ eers .
when I see these animations , oh Jesus , I &apos;m blown away .
and that &apos;s what I do with my furniture .
I would -- if anybody &apos;s got a whale skeleton they want to sell me , I &apos;ll put it in the studio .
it &apos;s true . because there &apos;s a soul in this whole thing .
so , it &apos;s going to end .
and in those days , I developed an ear to identify birds just by the sound of the bangs they made against the glass .
one is dead , one is alive . that must be necrophilia .
so I went out , collected the duck , and before I put it in the free@@ zer , I checked if the victim was indeed of the male sex .
I mean , it &apos;s a nice topic for a birthday party or at the coffee machine , but to share this among your peers is something different .
here &apos;s one of my fellow winners . that &apos;s Charles P@@ ax@@ ton who won the 2000 biology prize for his paper , &quot; Cour@@ tship behavior of os@@ tric@@ hes towards humans under farming conditions in Britain . &quot;
instead of drawing someone &apos;s face , like drawing the shape , I point at them with the eye and I write down the different notes I hear , and then I create sound portraits .
and I like to exhibit these paintings in the exhibition halls without labels , and then I ask people , &quot; Which one do you prefer ? &quot;
I &apos;ve always been interested in the relationship of formal structures and human behavior .
tens of thousands of discreet rules , 60 steps to suspend a student from school : it &apos;s a formula for paralysis .
people -- for law to be the platform for freedom , people have to trust it .
law has to be simple enough so that people can internalize it in their daily choices .
the first thing I want to do is say thank you to all of you .
they don &apos;t have the time to get to know us .
and Aristotle said , &quot; H@@ ah , they appreciated that sometimes to design rounded columns , you need to bend the rule . &quot;
judge Forer did what she was required to do , and then she quit the bench .
if you reward teachers for kids &apos; test scores , they stop caring about educating and only care about test preparation .
and so practical wisdom does not require heroic acts of self-@@ sacrifice on the part of practitioners .
so this was chapter one .
the global stockpile of highly enriched uranium is about 1,300 , at the low end , to about 2,@@ 100 metric tons .
now , plutonium , 10 to 13 pounds : this . this is enough plutonium to create a N@@ agas@@ a@@ ki@@ -@@ size atomic weapon .
it becomes very portable .
and if you &apos;re in the half-@@ mile radius of where this bomb went off , you have a 90 percent chance of not making it .
and I can see their point , because I started my career as a theoretical nuclear physicist .
can &apos;t you apply a definition , like for example , a Supreme Cour@@ t-like definition of life ? &quot;
I had two undergraduate students at California Institute of Technology that worked with me .
and obviously each of these letters comes off about roughly equally frequent .
and if you can do that , then you have life .
you can just go on Sol@@ ar@@ Im@@ pul@@ se@@ .com , subscribe to just be informed of what we &apos;re doing .
we went on the quiet to see for ourselves what was going on .
and in that moment , I started this journey .
as I say , there &apos;re two things on the line here .
we have a film , produced by Jon Kamen at Rad@@ ical Media .
the average waiting time to get a landline in Ethiopia is actually about seven or eight years .
communication is very important for Ethiopia -- will transform the country .
but a woman &apos;s got to do what a woman &apos;s got to do .
I &apos;m not so old .
crazy , I know . insane .
it was my doctor in Cleveland , Marie Bu@@ dev .
the last thing I remember was lying on a white blanket , telling my surgeon that I needed to see my mother again , and to please try and save my voice .
when we do , we will find that patients don &apos;t just survive ; we thrive .
the baby bottle scenario proves that we can prevent unnecessary exposure .
and it &apos;s interesting when you make a film like this , because you &apos;re stuck trying to visualize science that there &apos;s no visualization for .
and it &apos;s not just atrazine they &apos;re exposed to .
and I kept thinking over and over again this question .
and 60 seconds is the amount of time it took for it to travel 250 kilometers to Man@@ agua .
they were well respected . they were known .
well , it can be quite difficult , but you have to know what to look for .
and we didn &apos;t know if Rita existed or if it was a fake name .
three different sources said three different things about the bridge .
so we go a bit further . we switch to the satellite view , and we find another bridge , and everything starts to line up .
this is a flying buttress .
and in the last two to three summers , these invasive organisms , this kind of Ebola of the trees , as it were , has swept through the primeval Hemlock forest of the east , and has absolutely wiped it out . I climbed there this past summer .
it &apos;s been 25 years since the first PC virus hit the net , and what was once an anno@@ yance has become a sophisticated tool for crime and espionage . computer security expert Mik@@ ko Hyp@@ p@@ ö@@ n@@ en tells us how we can stop these new viruses from threatening the internet as we know it .
key@@ log@@ gers silently sit on your computer , hidden from view , and they record everything you type .
and I was looking at that , trying to figure out what it means .
and this is what runs our infrastructure .
for example , the elevators in this building most likely are controlled by one of these .
because everything around us is being run by these .
you go to any factory , any power plant , any chemical plant , any food processing plant , you look around -- everything is being run by computers .
we have to find the people with the skills , but without the opportunities and give them the opportunities to use their skills for good .
terrorists , they &apos;re rational .
pretty much everybody is rational .
if you &apos;re trying to influence corporations to change their behavior , with regard to producing pollutants , one approach , the common approach , is to ex@@ h@@ ort them to be better , to explain to them what damage they &apos;re doing to the planet .
Sally &apos;s giving her opinion to them , and they &apos;re giving their opinion to Sally .
and Harry wants to know what each of those people are saying to each other , and so on , and Sally would like to know what Harry thinks those people are saying .
if they don &apos;t know , who are the people trying to influence the decision , how much clout do they have , how much they care about this issue , and what do they say they want , are they experts ? that &apos;s what it means to be an expert , that &apos;s the basic stuff an expert needs to know .
one is : there &apos;s the science of achievement , which almost everything that &apos;s run is mastered to an amazing extent .
and everybody in this room -- you wouldn &apos;t be in this room if you bought that theory -- but the -- most of society thinks biography is destiny .
the history of our world is these decisions .
so if you had a time you did something , and after you did it you thought to yourself , I can &apos;t believe I said that , I can &apos;t believe I did that , that was so stupid -- who &apos;s been there ?
if you &apos;ve got a target and you &apos;ve got a map and let &apos;s say -- I can &apos;t use Google because I love Mac@@ s and they haven &apos;t made it good for Mac@@ s yet -- so if you use Map@@ Quest -- how many have made this fatal mistake of using Map@@ Quest at some time ?
we &apos;re watching the rising of the stars and the shifting of the tides .
they could synthesize patterns in nature using the rising and setting of stars , the sequence and direction of waves , the flight patterns of certain birds .
and this is what he said : &quot; the island is the canoe ; the canoe , the island . &quot;
and all it took to change things around was to allow for choice through rights identification .
and I can light up the N@@ ut@@ me@@ g like a beac@@ on .
you know , as I look around the world I see a lot of gaps , and I think we all see a lot of gaps .
&quot; I feel in love with Carolyn . &quot; &quot; I feel so naughty . &quot;
what makes you sad ? what do you believe in ? and so on .
you know , Orion facing the ro@@ aring bull .
so we see again , climate change is large : Nairobi , global conference , environmental .
so this is a fantastic machine that we can use for improving health care , but as I said , it &apos;s also a challenge for us .
first you saw the body bag that the body came in , then I &apos;m peeling off the skin -- you can see the muscles -- and eventually you can see the bone structure of this woman .
so this will be the typical workflow situation .
there &apos;s a YouTube video that you can download and look at this , if you want to convey the information to other people about virtual autopsies .
but the puzzle of why the universe emerged in that peculiar state is completely un@@ solved .
perhaps the universe existed before the bang , and the bang was just a violent event in a pre-@@ existing universe .
and a tiny distance away , there &apos;s another sheet , also three-dimensional , and they &apos;re separated by a gap .
but I learned that there was a desperate shortage of skills , especially mathematical skills , in industry , in government , in education .
and where they are is indicated over here .
it &apos;s got 120,000 processors ; they can basically process 10 quadrillion bits of information per second .
that &apos;s how much power this computer uses .
and when it &apos;s closed , you have a zero , but you have a few ones thrown in .
we didn &apos;t do this by actually writing code , like you do in a computer .
and these four types of information -- your optic nerve has about a million fibers in it , and 9@@ 00,000 of those fibers send these four types of information .
it doesn &apos;t light up green everywhere in the background , only on the edges , and then in the hair , and so on .
it was very brute force ; it was very in@@ elegant .
and this one , this one goes around in a human lifetime .
now , truth in advertising . right ?
the young ones are blue . and the yellow ones , we don &apos;t know yet .
and on a much longer time scale , what we hope to do is build even larger telescopes , because , remember , bigger is better in astronomy .
he didn &apos;t read a note , and he was profoundly hearing impaired .
but the way we react to different combinations of these phenomena is complex and emotional and not totally understood .
and every musical era had different priorities of these things , different things to pass on , different &apos; wh@@ ats &apos; and &apos; ho@@ ws &apos; .
and perhaps its tremendous intellectual perfection and serenity meant that something new had to happen -- a radical new move , which in 1@@ 600 is what did happen .
37 fre@@ akin &apos; vibrations .
a piece like Beethoven &apos;s Fifth basically witnessing how it was possible for him to go from sorrow and anger , over the course of a half an hour , step by exac@@ ting step of his route , to the moment when he could make it across to joy .
well let me show you a story of what I mean by &quot; really sticking with us . &quot;
so you ask , how big are those machines ?
Chris Anderson : how web video powers global innovation
it &apos;s a phenomenon that I think any organization or individual can tap into .
and the desire part comes , I guess , from social status , right ?
all those ideas are already out there in print .
we may have to reinvent an ancient art form .
of course we don &apos;t .
well I can &apos;t , in the time I &apos;ve got , give huge numbers of examples , but let me just give a few of the ways that life can change .
it is a crime map . this is a crime map from Chicago .
we &apos;re being advised by some of these people , as was said , to try and bring all the experience to book .
then we like to take things apart .
the 20 ar@@ ron@@ dis@@ se@@ ments of Paris are these little neighborhoods .
we don &apos;t really believe in cameras to do things in homes .
we need shared spaces for interaction and collaboration .
there &apos;s no reason why we can &apos;t dramatically improve the li@@ v@@ ability and creativity of cities like they &apos;ve done in Mel@@ bour@@ ne with the lan@@ e@@ ways while at the same time dramatically reducing CO2 and energy .
a satellite tag only works when the air is clear of the water and can send a signal to the satellite .
and I had friends who were really good kids , who lived out the Dr. Je@@ k@@ y@@ ll Mr. Hy@@ de scenario -- Robert Louis St@@ evenson .
who are the bad apples ? &quot; well , that &apos;s a bad question .
who are the cast of characters ? what &apos;s the costume ?
ordinary people : bar@@ bers , cler@@ ks , white-@@ collar people .
he persuaded them to commit mass suicide .
bullying is a disease . prejudice is a disease . violence is a disease .
that &apos;s a decision that you have to make . that &apos;s a personal thing .
very odd -- I &apos;ve analyzed this for a while .
and in that image there , you see a variety of islands of what I call image-making regions in the brain .
so here &apos;s how it looks . look at the region there .
and finally , medicine .
Cour@@ t@@ ney Martin : reinventing feminism
I was raised on &quot; Free to be you and me &quot; -- hip-hop -- not as many woo@@ ho@@ os for hip-hop in the house .
pay equity ? yes . absolutely a feminist issue .
I realized feminism wasn &apos;t about man-@@ hating and Bir@@ ken@@ stocks . &quot;
and we can barely find the time to reflect deeply back in on our own selves .
and we feel like we have to get far , far away to a sec@@ lu@@ ded retreat , leaving it all behind .
brain@@ wave technology can understand us , anticipate our emotions and find the best solutions for our needs .
imagine this collected awareness of the individual compu@@ ted and reflected across an entire lifespan .
or you could tag Facebook photos with the emotions that you had associated with those memories and then instantly prioritize the streams that catch your attention , just like this .
do you know what causes fatigue in you or what brings out your energetic self , what triggers cause you to be depressed or what fun things are going to bring you out of that fun@@ k ?
because they were all about being free , the wind in your hair -- just to be free .
and then I went to business school .
I &apos;m going to go across India on the back of an elephant .
because , when you make a decision at the right time and the right place , God , that universe makes it happen for you .
it &apos;s not ci@@ v@@ ically rich enough for them to go down there .
we &apos;re going to have to do something else instead .
we &apos;re going to have to down-@@ scale , re-@@ scale , and re-@@ size virtually everything we do in this country and we can &apos;t start soon enough to do it .
and we &apos;re going to fix them by imposing back on them street and block systems and returning to the building lot as the normal increment of development .
she got to that bottom secret , his proposal to her .
the Digital Universe is the basis of our space show productions that we do -- our main space shows in the dome .
coming in closer , picking up Earth , orbit of the Moon , and we see the Earth .
so all the para@@ meter fitting , and really the technology was stretched at that point to fit just Dan .
there was this hero , Odysseus , who &apos;s heading back home after the Trojan War .
he said that , &quot; We might neglect our future selves because of some failure of belief or imagination . &quot;
here we see the face of the young subject on the left .
if you save very little , the future self is unhappy living on 44 percent of the income .
indeed , to implement the slogan of Health for All , we will need to involve all in that particular journey , and in the case of mental health , in particular we would need to involve people who are affected by mental illness and their caregivers .
economics has become the currency of policy .
it completely passes below the radar screen .
today , the depletion of ocean fisheries is so significant that effectively it is eff@@ ecting the ability of the poor , the artisanal fish@@ er folk and those who fish for their own livelihoods , to feed their families .
how bad can things get ?
if it &apos;s yellow , it &apos;s 40 to 60 percent .
these red dots , these red areas , basically provide the food and livelihood for more than half a billion people .
he wanted to go out and do an experiment .
he asked all his friends that he thought were good physicists , &quot; Was it your mom or your pop that influenced you ? &quot;
the proton is obviously made of a whole bunch of little particles .
the only problem was that Feynman diagrams are complicated .
so I think I &apos;ll just finish up by saying I actually don &apos;t think Feynman would have liked this event .
the biggest difficulty on one of these trailers is that when you &apos;re designing there &apos;s actually no logical place to stop and start materials because of the continuous form of the trailer .
I &apos;m a contract computer scientist by trade , but I &apos;m the founder of something called the Tinkering School .
and it wouldn &apos;t be fun to talk about the space age without seeing a flag that was carried to the moon and back , on Apollo 11 .
part of the question that I have answered is , is we create by surrounding ourselves with stimuli : with human achievement , with history , with the things that drive us and make us human -- the passionate discovery , the bones of dinosaurs long gone , the maps of space that we &apos;ve experienced , and ultimately the hall@@ ways that stimulate our mind and our imagination .
and once we create new patterns in this brain , once we shape the brain in a new way , it never returns to its original shape .
the connection is the energy it takes to run the web , and to make everything we think possible , possible .
the ball is driven by three special wheels that allow Rezero to move into any direction and also move around his own axis at the same time .
to say I wonder is to say I question , I ask .
my 4@@ 4th patent ; about the 15th invention .
we &apos;ve been selling it since about last September , October , and it &apos;s been immensely gratifying .
so , again , this idea of being able to put sound anywhere you want to is really starting to catch on .
big mistake : it just sold for 80 million dollars two years ago .
so I stayed up at night , and I talked to my husband , &quot; How do I give President Obama a periodic table ?
and I thought molecular weight sounded much less nerdy than mol@@ ar mass .
basically , you make an amplification in the lab , and then you get it to self-assemble into a structure like a battery .
it seems like it &apos;s perfectly reasonable to ask that .
and this sort of whole phenomenon of having short bursts of time to get things done reminds me of another thing that doesn &apos;t work when you &apos;re interrupted , and that is sleep .
now , managers and bosses will often have you think that the real distractions at work are things like Facebook and Twitter and YouTube and other websites , and in fact , they &apos;ll go so far as to actually ban these sites at work .
there &apos;s often too many people in the meetings , and they &apos;re very , very expensive to the organization .
and I specialize in human behavioral research , and applying what we learn to think about the future in different ways , and to design for that future .
but really , the question is , why ? right ?
and you can do them with phone kios@@ ks .
OK , the next thing is -- most of you , if you have a stable home life , and what I mean is that you don &apos;t travel all the time , and always in hotels , but most people have what we call a center of gravity .
so what I do is , I buy a prepaid card like this .
and we look at this and we think , well , how does that apply , for example , for the design of -- the lessons from this -- apply to the design of online services , future services in these markets ?
so we &apos;ve developed certain tactics and strategies to cover up .
I &apos;m just the messenger .
Kathryn Schul@@ z : don &apos;t regret regret
and then three years later -- which in fairness , kind of is forever by Hollywood standards -- they broke up , and Johnny went and got a little bit of repair work done .
in other words , I had drunk our great cultural Kool@@ -@@ Aid about regret , which is that lam@@ enting things that occurred in the past is an absolute waste of time , that we should always look forward and not backward , and that one of the no@@ ble@@ st and best things we can do is strive to live a life free of regrets .
so let &apos;s say for instance that you &apos;re on your way to your best friend &apos;s wedding and you &apos;re trying to get to the airport and you &apos;re stuck in terrible traffic , and you finally arrive at your gate and you &apos;ve missed your flight .
we just want it to vanish .
I got this tattoo because I spent most of my 20s living outside the country and traveling .
now we have taken on a second thing , and this gets to my wish .
and the results were so good that the Rwandan government has now agreed to adopt the model for the entire country , and has strongly supported and put the full resources of the government behind it .
400,000 pregnant women were brought into counseling and will give birth for the first time within an organized healthcare system .
I have four kids , and even if part of what he says is true , they &apos;re not going to have the life that I had .
the classrooms have no walls .
at Green School , the children are smiling -- an unusual thing for school , especially for me .
he &apos;s planning to eat that fence for dinner .
it has administrators in it and many , many other things .
so we contacted a company in Scotland that created personalized computer voices .
this is the first voice they &apos;ve created for an individual .
all of this has happened in my lifetime .
I was in line at Radio Shack to buy one of the first Model 100 &apos;s .
it is human nature to look away from illness .
my ability to think and write have not been affected .
I &apos;ve got a bowl full of boiling water -- the first one who comes in here , gets it . &quot;
it &apos;s your major artery , and it was se@@ vered , so my blood was gur@@ gling out of my mouth .
so there were all these skills and talents that these seniors had .
and then the next thing that I needed was a makeover .
the redundancy was actually good for me .
and he referred me to this lovely quote from the Japanese &quot; Es@@ says in I@@ d@@ leness &quot; from the 14th century , in which the es@@ say@@ ist wrote , &quot; In everything , uniformity is undesirable .
I think one of the problems about school mathematics is it doesn &apos;t look at how mathematics is embedded in the world we live in .
but what I could do is just leave it where it is , pick it up , and put it down again .
21 . okay good . how many do you have in yours ?
it was the beginning of a much higher degree of inequality among people .
and we are also changing our teeth right now .
that was the Pa@@ ige type@@ se@@ tter .
if we think , for example , of Louis Pa@@ ste@@ ur , who in the 18@@ 60s was asked to study the diseases of silk worms for the silk industry , and his discoveries were really the beginning of the germ theory of disease .
we need to learn from those figures that I mentioned .
so , I kind of believe that we &apos;re in like the &quot; ca@@ ve-@@ painting &quot; era of computer interfaces .
and what he &apos;s done is he &apos;s actually reshaped , digitally , all of the contours of the mountains to follow the vic@@ is@@ situ@@ des of the Dow Jones index .
and I said , &quot; What &apos;s the black box for Wall Street ? &quot;
and that &apos;s 70 percent of the United States stock market , 70 percent of the operating system formerly known as your pension , your mortgage .
but very often several days later , the patient &apos;s gone home , we get a phone call : &quot; I &apos;m sorry , once we looked at the final pathology , once we looked at the final specimen , we actually found that there &apos;s a couple other spots where the margins are positive .
and they &apos;re known because somebody has decided to study them , which means that we &apos;re still learning about where they are .
it is not an event for the solo runner .
successful innovation is a team sport , it &apos;s a relay race .
and this process , which takes just a millisecond or so , happens thousands of times a minute in every one of your 100 billion cells , as long as you live and think and feel .
you take this DNA and you put it into a neuron .
I already told you that electrical stimulators are not uncommon .
so with blue light , we can drive information , and it &apos;s in the form of a one .
and for this reason , many people eat pro@@ biotic yogurt so they can promote a healthy gut flora .
and I thought , well , this is the power of a city .
but nonetheless , just 20 blocks north , two days later , the city had never looked more alive .
so I wanted to talk a little bit about the reasons why that works so well , and how some of those reasons kind of map on to where the Web is going right now .
well , you know , we should expect to see that .
so Richard Saul Wurman has about a 15 percent Google Share of the TED conference .
it just came out . this is bur@@ sty words , looking at the historical record of State of the Union Ad@@ dresses .
commerce , on the other hand , is relatively quick , essentially creative , highly effective and efficient , and fundamentally honest , because we can &apos;t exchange value for very long if we don &apos;t trust each other .
if we come here and say , &quot; Well , I didn &apos;t intend to cause global warming on the way here , &quot; and we say , &quot; That &apos;s not part of my plan , &quot; then we realize it &apos;s part of our de facto plan .
if the end game is mercury toxi@@ fication of our children downwind of coal fire plants as they sc@@ ut@@ tled the Clean Air Act , then I see that our education programs should be explicitly defined as , &quot; Brain death for all children . no child left behind . &quot;
my grandfather had been a lum@@ ber@@ jack in the Olympics , so I have a lot of tree karma I am working off .
it was recently dragged for plankton by scientists , and they found six times as much plastic as plankton .
and as Francis Crick pointed out , nine years after discovering DNA with Mr. Watson , that life itself has to have growth as a pre@@ condition -- it has to have free energy , sunlight and it needs to be an open system of chemicals .
and that &apos;s shown here in the the very light blue .
now this may look like a bunch of dots to you , but each one of these individual dots is actually a unique piece of the human genome that we spotted down on glass .
and remember that we &apos;ve assa@@ yed all the 25,000 genes in the genome and have all of that data available .
imagine you have a few million dollars that you &apos;ve raised -- maybe you &apos;re a politician in a developing country and you have a budget to spend . you want to spend it on the poor : how do you go about it ?
so I start with immunization .
and that &apos;s not bad . for your hundred dollars , you get between one and three extra years of education .
but look what we just did today .
so this evidence is powerful .
so it &apos;s a slow process , but there is no other way .
because it is actually a long-term play .
so they want to emerge as an industrial power@@ house across the industries -- away from oil .
if I had to ask you , &quot; In 2005 what was the best performing stock market or stock exchange in the world ? &quot; would Egypt come to mind ?
10 years ago there , were very few countries that received sovereign ratings from the Stand@@ ard &amp; Po@@ ors , Moo@@ dy &apos;s and F@@ it@@ ch &apos;s .
so that &apos;s the change that &apos;s coming down the pipeline .
what should I try to emulate to some degree ?
when I showed it , and I asked , immediately after the screening was over , what they thought of it , what was your memorable shots , they changed them .
it &apos;s what you dream about .
OK , reverse your hands .
KT : no , no , I &apos;m just still looking at the road .
has anybody here seen that film ? yeah .
do you remember when they threw the Coke bottle out of the airplane , and it landed on the ground , and it didn &apos;t break ?
I &apos;ve got one more thing to share with you right now .
one , two , three and four .
I &apos;m going to have the last laugh , though .
KB : no ? good decision .
this is your decision , not mine .
two things .
so it &apos;s empathy that makes us connect to other people .
so to investigate immorality , let me bring you back now to 1980 .
come here . give me a hug .
on your right is an eight-year-old .
I gave them a speech@@ -to-@@ text engine in a computer , and I said , &quot; Keep talking into it until it types what you say . &quot;
so I said , &quot; Well , what did I expect ? &quot;
neurons ... communication .
he main@@ tains law and order , because remember , there &apos;s no teacher around .
they built the first curriculum , but we &apos;ve lost sight of those wondrous questions .
thank you . ooh , I &apos;m like , &quot; P@@ hew , phew , calm down . get back into my body now . &quot;
you &apos;re really sensitive to your body and its functions when you &apos;re behind this thing .
just the basic feeling .
that of a difference . then gradually ... and gradually ...
can be felt with just the tiniest part of your finger , there .
because that isn &apos;t giving me enough of something that is so raw and so basic , and something that I can fully experience the journey of .
and so therefore , acoustici@@ ans are actually in conversation with people who are hearing impaired , and who are participat@@ ors of sound .
it may be that the chemistry isn &apos;t quite right between myself and that particular piece of music , but that doesn &apos;t mean I have the right to say it &apos;s a bad piece of music .
I may feel sor@@ row@@ ful , or happy , or exhilar@@ ated , or angry when I play certain pieces of music , but I &apos;m not necessarily wanting you to feel exactly the same thing .
and I will spare you that slide .
dusty is the name that we &apos;ve given to this cat .
and the thing is , I didn &apos;t make it into that presentation because I can &apos;t read to you anything that they said , more or less .
CP : the commercial picture is that there really isn &apos;t much of one , I guess .
CP : at first , very kind of pa@@ ined , awkward conversations .
six@@ ty-five million years ago , a very important and catastrophic event changed the course of life on land .
the ground surface at 150 -- typical .
it has no big claw on its hind foot . it doesn &apos;t look like a V@@ elo@@ cirap@@ tor .
man : OK , hand me some more here . man 2 : OK .
Whoa !
they &apos;re really kin@@ dred disciplines .
the gun goes off , and she &apos;s not even an underdog .
well , there are teams of scientists at Harvard and the University of Utah that are bending their brains to try to figure out what the Tarahumara have known forever .
to have a brain of that size , you need to have a source of condensed caloric energy .
now I &apos;ve been to a lot of marathons , and I &apos;ve yet to see any ...
robotics had really been about interacting with things , not with people -- certainly not in a social way that would be natural for us and would really help people accept robots into our daily lives .
I like to think of this as the A@@ tari Pong of this bl@@ ende@@ d-@@ reality play .
it turns out that kids love it when the character becomes real and enters into their world .
I really want to come up with new ways of children &apos;s media that foster creativity and learning and innovation .
so I created this image of Diana , Dod@@ i and their imaginary mix@@ ed-@@ race child and this image came out , which caused a huge public outcry at the time .
what Jack Nichol@@ son might be up to in his celebrity life , and the fact that he tried to ... he had a bit of road rage and gol@@ f-@@ clu@@ bbed a driver the other day .
you &apos;re having a heart attack . what are you going to do ?
no , you will die . 50 percent will die within 24 hours , if not treated .
this is what &apos;s going on .
in my work with cattle , I noticed a lot of little things that most people don &apos;t notice would make the cattle bal@@ k . like , for example , this flag waving , right in front of the veter@@ inary facility .
just really quickly , like Google for pictures .
now , I had this brain scan done several years ago , and I used to joke around about having a gigantic Internet trunk line going deep into my visual cortex .
now , here is a horse that was death@@ ly afraid of black cowboy hats .
he was now Dr. Car@@ lock in the movie .
and he got me challenged to figure out an optical illusion room .
all right . let &apos;s try this .
you &apos;ve got to do what you want to do .
somehow , 13 billion years ago there was a Big Bang , and you &apos;ve heard a little bit about , you know , the origin of the universe .
so , think about it as a paper-@@ thin , huge area of many hundreds of thousands of miles , which is rotating .
we can look inside with real time fMRI -- in the brain at real time .
compare those two pictures , and now as a radiologist , you can essentially fly through your patient &apos;s colon and , augmenting that with artificial intelligence , identify potentially , as you see here , a lesion .
and as you saw just about a month ago , Watson from IBM beat the two champions in Je@@ opardy .
this was developed by colleagues at Stanford , called the i@@ R@@ hythm -- completely sup@@ plants the prior technology at a much lower price point with much more effec@@ tivity .
but it &apos;s going to be here .
now we &apos;ve heard a lot today about new technology and connection .
so the surgeon can see inside the patient , through their lens , where the tumor is , where the blood vessels are .
geome@@ dicine : where you &apos;ve lived , what you &apos;ve been exposed to , can dramatically affect your health .
Ger@@ on , just last year , started the first trial using human embryonic stem cells to treat spinal cord injuries .
the display was a photo . men and women stripped naked , some trying to cover their genit@@ als , others too frightened to bother , lined up in snow waiting to be shot and thrown into a ditch .
many people credit a lot of the birth of the environmental movement to our seeing the planet like this for the first time -- its small@@ ness , its fragility .
the publication of those images , as opposed to the images themselves , caused a government to change its policies .
I &apos;d read lots of books . I studied maps and charts .
she started crying . she asked me to call her back .
Ben , could you please look for an airstrip ? &quot;
it just about worked . a pretty dramatic landing -- the plane actually passed over four times , and I was a bit worried it wasn &apos;t going to land at all .
so I thought , I &apos;ve got to compose myself for Troy .
Troy was smoking a cigarette on the ice ; we took a few photos . he climbed up the ladder . he said , &quot; Just -- just get in the back . &quot;
a few years ago , I was running some of my own experiments in the lab .
now we might just as easily call these fears by a different name .
of all the narratives their fears wrote , they responded only to the most lur@@ id , the most vivid , the one that was easiest for their imaginations to picture : cannibals .
so she was making a politically rational decision .
I do speak to sex workers , 15,000 of them for this particular slide , and this is what sex workers say they earn in an hour .
Ines : so why is prevalence still rising ?
would you like to see foreign troops on your land ? &quot;
and they said , &quot; These kids are mis@@ led . &quot;
always , we believed that change will spring from within , that change should be a reconciliation with culture , cultural diversity , with our faith in our tradition and in our history , but at the same time , open to universal values , connected with the world , tolerant to the outside .
the future should be ruled by people themselves , even sometimes if they are voices that might now scare us .
and I &apos;d pull her out on the front porch .
and we &apos;d sing this old song . she didn &apos;t have a whole lot of energy , so I &apos;d sing , &quot; Hey , hey ! &quot; and she &apos;d just answer back with , &quot; Black@@ -@@ eyed Susie . &quot;
Hey , hey , black-eyed Susie , hey .
good news : chariot &apos;s coming .
I showed you some of the ham@@ bone rhythms yesterday ; I &apos;m going to be doing some of the same ones .
colored them in a very particular way by having a friend of mine write a piece of software , the Casa da Musica Logo Gener@@ ator .
but one of the principles is that everybody who is part of the community gets to fight and argue as hard as they can for what they believe .
so this is general relativity , this is quantum theory .
and so we will evaluate them .
and then as they grow older , the horns grow forward .
and the last one is T. Re@@ x .
and of course , Nano has 17 .
so nice , all week . he &apos;s the kind of man you could say to , &quot; Chris , I &apos;m really sorry , I &apos;ve crashed your car .
spectroscopy , that was another one .
: &quot; yeah , alright , come on , eh .
but the people , when talking about the finance industry , he said , &quot; What you as the city of London have done for financial services , we , as a government , hope to do for the economy as a whole . &quot;
these extraordinary things , Icelandic Internet accounts .
that &apos;s why the Prime Minister went on television . he said , &quot; This has left us all with a very big ha@@ d@@ dock . &quot;
he was speaking at a dinner , he said , &quot; Wall Street got drunk . &quot;
I know folks said to me they believe it was one of the greatest errors in the history of the United States .
but we proved them wrong in Iraq .
but the interesting thing is , Gordon Brown was talking about Cic@@ ero , who said , people would listen to a speech , they said , &quot; Great speech . &quot;
he leaves , people go , &quot; No no no , we &apos;re not going to do that .
the previous highest honor he had in Britain was a visit from the team from Ground Force , a gardening program .
three thousand years ago , civilization just getting started on the banks of the Nile , some slaves , Jewish shepherds in this instance , smelling of sheep shit , I guess , pro@@ claimed to the Pharaoh , sitting high on his throne , &quot; We , your maj@@ est@@ y-ness , are equal to you . &quot;
they turn a social network from virtual to actual , and kind of re@@ bo@@ oted the 21st century .
it &apos;s called momentum .
and it &apos;s how we can bend the arc of history down towards zero , just doing the things that we know work .
2030 ? by 2030 , robots , not just serving us Guinness , but drinking it .
&quot; we are going to win because we don &apos;t understand politics .
if your bank account &apos;s one dollar , and you flip a single bit , you could end up with a thousand dollars .
so one big question is , how does a baby know when to stop growing ?
and you can see a little bit of double helix forming there .
when you look at DNA origami , you can see that what it really is , even though you think it &apos;s complicated , is a bunch of double helic@@ es that are parallel to each other , and they &apos;re held together by places where short strands go along one helix and then jump to another one .
and you can make a map of the Americas and spell DNA with DNA .
so it &apos;s very promising for making small computers .
but as we envisioned it , we had three key goals : providing world-class life support ambulance service which is fully self-@@ sustainable from its own revenue streams , and universally accessible to anyone in a medical emergency , irrespective of the capability to pay .
imagine you are being asked to pay a bribe in your day-to-day life to get something done .
what gives us the courage ?
but the one thing I want you to notice about them is this : even though this is a very long list , there isn &apos;t a single thing on it that involves other human beings .
you need the time to get to know the people that you &apos;re serving .
I &apos;ll just give you one example because time is racing .
in Switzerland , back about 15 years ago , they were trying to decide where to site nuclear waste dumps .
acknowledge , when you go to law school , that a little voice is whispering in your ear about At@@ ticus F@@ inch .
&quot; maybe on paper our company is worth less to Wall Street , but I can tell you it &apos;s worth more . we &apos;re doing fine . &quot;
and it turns out that with 60 Min@@ utes cameras rolling in the background , after he pretty much made his position clear on this -- he had his hook and he had his -- he wore this arm for less than two hours and was able to pour himself a drink and got quite emotional over the fact that , quote -- his quote -- it &apos;s the first time he &apos;s felt like he &apos;s had an arm in 39 years .
he &apos;s pun@@ ching our controls guy . the guy behind him is our engineer / surgeon , which is a convenient guy to have around .
and we were trying to get them to all help us know what to give them .
and I was thinking , &quot; We didn &apos;t give them support and encouragement ; they gave it to us .
&quot; you &apos;ll get them . &quot;
and I stayed inside of that water tank hoping my core temperature would start to drop .
so , basically what that means is I would pur@@ ge , I &apos;d breath really hard for a minute .
basically , I &apos;m not the best person to talk to when I &apos;m doing that stuff .
my brother had a picture of it . it is really ...
but the majority of the world neither benefits from capitalism nor from democratic systems .
we have three critical terms : economy , civil society and the state .
and we need to understand , it &apos;s the value chain .
the aid system does not have the knowledge , the vision , the ability .
there &apos;s two degrees , or three degrees of climate change baked into the system .
we may see the eradication of polio this year .
so what I did actually is to study this problem , and I found something quite surprising .
you must do it differently .
and , in fact , they did it with monkeys .
it &apos;s not just insects .
we &apos;ve taken away the autonomy of this animal . &quot;
and it &apos;s not just technology that we &apos;re putting into animals .
and so , we need to ask ourselves some questions .
U@@ V@@ B turns out to be incredibly important .
you are going to solve a series of puzzles , and I &apos;m going to show you examples of these puzzles momentarily .
it has now been five years , slightly more than five years , and the good news , thank God , is that the cancer is still in re@@ mission .
this is a tragic example of arrested development , or a bud@@ ding green revolution stopped in its tracks .
in a way , the static , stone mountain becomes a moving mountain of sand .
trees or cac@@ ti are good for this .
what happens is , you pour Bac@@ illus paste@@ uri@@ i onto a pile of sand , and it starts filling up the voids in between the grains .
and I realized that if I scaled them up , they would provide me with good spatial qualities , for ventilation , for thermal comfort , and for other things .
if we can lower the barriers to farming , building , manufacturing , then we can unleash just massive amounts of human potential .
we were the best and the brightest .
the waves were 25 to 50 feet high .
the governments of the world are taking this really seriously .
that this old man would interrupt his moonlight stroll with his sweetheart with the precise reason of making fun of a child .
I did not know why they were teasing me .
the old man reached out his kno@@ b@@ bly claw for the woman &apos;s hand , and found it , and left me alone .
I need not remind you that this was David Lyn@@ ch &apos;s version of &quot; D@@ une , &quot; in which all of the characters were sexy and deformed at the same time .
one : Whit@@ ley S@@ trieber was played by Christopher Wal@@ ken .
four : this was being shown in a regular movie theater in Center City , Philadelphia .
as the world faces recession , climate change , inequity and more , Tim Jackson delivers a piercing challenge to established economic principles , explaining how we might stop feeding the crises and start investing in our future .
trash the system or crash the planet -- it &apos;s a tough choice ; it isn &apos;t much of a choice .
Joseph Sch@@ um@@ pe@@ ter called this &quot; the process of creative destruction . &quot;
and to stop it crashing over the last two to three decades , we &apos;ve expanded the money supply , expanded credit and debt , so that people can keep buying stuff .
investment has to be , in the new economy , protecting and nurturing the ecological assets on which our future depends .
it &apos;s clear that we have a responsibility to help lift them out of poverty .
can you picture the politicians ever buying into this ?
when we first started this kind of work , politicians would stand up , treas@@ ury spokes@@ men would stand up , and accuse us of wanting to go back and live in caves .
it &apos;ll just bake your retinas .
and it also the kind of root of how we see oil as a conspiracy .
and so I &apos;m not saying these guys aren &apos;t li@@ able to answer questions -- I &apos;m just saying that , when you focus on whether they are or are not a bunch of greedy bastards , you don &apos;t actually get around to the point of making laws that are either going to either change the way they operate , or you &apos;re going to get around to really reducing the amount of oil and reducing our dependence on oil .
but it makes for good theater , and it &apos;s powerfully cathartic as you probably saw last week .
and so what we did was , actually , we made moratoriums on the east and west co@@ asts on drilling .
one of the things that &apos;s happened because of this is that , since 1969 , the country of Nigeria , or the part of Nigeria that pumps oil , which is the delta -- which is two times the size of Maryland -- has had thousands of oil spills a year .
we pay for it on April 15th , and we can &apos;t even calculate the cost of this involvement .
Cynthia Schneider looks at two international &quot; American Idol &quot; -style shows -- one in Afghanistan , and one in the United Arab E@@ mir@@ ates -- and shows the surprising effect that these real@@ ity-@@ TV competitions are creating in their societies .
Cynthia Schneider : the surprising spread of &quot; Idol &quot; TV
and the final , sort of , formulation of this &quot; American Idol &quot; format , which has just appeared in Afghanistan , is a new program called &quot; The Can@@ di@@ date . &quot;
and I &apos;ve come here to ask you today : what radical tactical shift can you take in your relationship to the environment , which will ensure that our children and our grandchildren live in a safe world and a secure world , and most importantly , in a sustainable world ?
I usually say to people , when they say , &quot; What do you do ? &quot;
and it tends to feel a little overwhelming when we look at what is there in reality today and the magnitude of the problem that we face .
every city determines to a very large extent the amount of energy used by its inhabitants .
when you can get rid of all of those because somebody doesn &apos;t use any of them really , you find that you can actually cut transportation emissions as much as 90 percent .
some of it is about walking . it &apos;s not all perfect yet .
we &apos;re finding that people can share the same spaces , do stuff with vacant space .
and if we &apos;re going to really , truly become sustainable cities , we need to think a little differently .
let me take you on a journey of several powers of 10 -- from the millennium scale to the year scale -- to try to persuade you of this . until 10,000 years ago , all humans lived as hunter-gather@@ ers , without permanent settlements or government . and this is the state that &apos;s commonly thought to be one of primordial harmony . but the archae@@ ologist Lawrence Ke@@ el@@ ey , looking at casu@@ alty rates among contemporary hunter-gather@@ ers , which is our best source of evidence about this way of life , has shown a rather different conclusion .
and they range from a rate of almost a 60 percent chance that a man will die at the hands of another man to , in the case of the Ge@@ bu@@ si , only a 15 percent chance . the tiny , little blue bar in the lower left-hand corner plots the corresponding statistic from United States and Europe in the twentieth century , and includes all the deaths of both World Wars . if the death rate in tribal warfare had prevailed during the 20th century , there would have been two billion deaths rather than 100 million .
so that &apos;s a bit of a support for the le@@ vi@@ athan theory .
then the developing countries applied soap and water , vaccination .
so the problem I had is that the worldview that my students had corresponds to reality in the world the year their teachers were born .
the middle income countries , the emerging economy , they are catching up .
it &apos;s the most tropical country in the world , a mar@@ sh@@ land on the equator .
these yellow are just about to be doing this .
you see the tragedy in South Africa there .
and you can see it &apos;s not that easy , that it is war which caused this .
and this is the situation you see .
but it &apos;s much more than Ebola that has been affected by this disease .
you have them in hunter-gatherer societies , but then through technological evolution , new forms of technology arise that facilitate or encourage the playing of non-zero-sum games , involving more people over larger territory .
but hey , I don &apos;t really see any alternative , given the way I read the situation .
it &apos;s when your welfare conduc@@ es to mine , that I decide , oh yeah , I &apos;m all in favor of your welfare . that &apos;s what &apos;s responsible for this growth of this moral progress so far , and I &apos;m saying we once again have a correlation of fortunes , and if people respond to it intelligently , we will see the development of tolerance and so on -- the norms that we need , you know .
so they came to me -- CNN -- and they said , &quot; Professor Seligman , would you tell us about the state of psychology today ?
and by parallel summary , I want to say the same thing about technology , about entertainment and design , because I think the issues are very similar .
and then we were able to test them ri@@ gor@@ ously , in random assignment , placebo controlled designs , throw out the things that didn &apos;t work , keep the things that actively did .
gratitude visit . I want you all to do this with me now , if you would .
but it &apos;s so heartening to be in a group like this , in which so many of you have turned your lives to philanthropy .
because despair , civil war , hunger and famine , although they &apos;re part and par@@ cel of our African reality , they are not the only reality .
you need W@@ em@@ b@@ ley Sta@@ dium to host our parliament .
the original intent was to travel there and bring back a classic story of diverse species , of an exotic loc@@ ale .
sometimes you can tell a broad story in a focused way .
so instead , what we did was we decided to , instead of going out and doing what would result in what we &apos;d consider sort of a survey story -- where you just go in and see just a little bit of everything -- we put Jonas into Dhar@@ av@@ i , which is part of Mumbai , India , and let him stay there , and really get into the heart and soul of this really major part of the city .
here , in a photo by Brian , a seemingly crucified shark is caught up in a gill net off of Ba@@ ja .
and here in China , Randy shot a jellyfish market .
and thank you very much .
this is not local population , this is rebels .
and it &apos;s kind of like a high altitude mountain@@ eering trip in reverse , except that you &apos;re now running a string of these things down .
next year I &apos;ll be leading an international team to J@@ 2 .
when you do this kind of stuff it &apos;s like doing E@@ VA .
this is Europa .
if we see something that looks interesting , we pull it into a microscope .
you &apos;d pay 10,000 dollars for that in orbit .
you can dive into the stratosphere , and precisely dissipate that velocity , and come back out to the space station .
and that includes nature , and nurture , and what I refer to as nightmares .
and it &apos;s the same thing in looking at these questions of how things happen .
it was something I read in an editorial by a woman who was talking about the war in Iraq . and she said , &quot; Save a man from drowning , you are responsible to him for life . &quot;
sometimes I get help from the universe , it seems .
here &apos;s a magazine called &quot; Hy@@ dr@@ ate . &quot; it &apos;s 180 pages about water .
cows are invisible . cows are boring .
but the reason it &apos;s number one is because that &apos;s the week it came out .
we &apos;re now in the fashion business , no matter what we do for a living , we &apos;re in the fashion business .
and every single person who walks into his office hears the whole story of how this thing ended up on his desk .
Proc@@ tor and Gamble knows this , right ?
and I went to the island of B@@ im@@ ini , in the Bahamas , to work with lemon shark pups .
this is a picture that shows the tail of a right whale .
these are ent@@ ang@@ lement scars .
for example , these fish pre@@ date on sea urchins , and when the fish were all gone , all anyone ever saw underwater was just acres and acres of sea urchins .
the ocean is , indeed , resilient and tolerant to a point , but we must be good custo@@ dians .
it &apos;s not good .
March .
that is the short-term solution but you also need a long-term solution .
but , it &apos;s more complicated . it &apos;s not that simple , and you have to work with the people .
we could have planted many , many more , but we didn &apos;t want to because we wanted to keep the number of jobs stable .
you do need to know what you are working with , but it &apos;s that diversity which makes it work .
I &apos;m working in cities for almost 40 years , and where every mayor is trying to tell me his city is so big , or the other may@@ ors say , &quot; We don &apos;t have financial resources , &quot; I would like to say from the experience I had : every city in the world can be improved in less than three years .
I would like to say , if we want to have a sustainable world we have to work with everything what &apos;s said , but don &apos;t forget the cities and the children .
Al Gore spoke at the TED conference I spoke at four years ago and talked about the climate crisis .
and human resources are like natural resources ; they &apos;re often buried deep .
this has to be transformed into something else .
the occasion is piled high with difficulty , and we must rise with the occasion . &quot;
so let me ask you something you may take for granted .
in half a century of trying to help prevent wars , there &apos;s one question that never leaves me : how do we deal with extreme violence without using force in return ?
and I started to cry .
but I realized that what I really needed to know I couldn &apos;t get from training courses .
so what does work ?
when do I give in ?
Hal@@ f-@@ past seven , we &apos;re getting up and that &apos;s what we &apos;re going to do . &quot;
it &apos;s people joining up with people , as Bundy just said , miles away to bring about change .
and this is so infuri@@ ating and humiliating for the population of Afghanistan , that it makes the recruit@@ ment for al-@@ Qaeda very easy , when people are so disgu@@ sted by , for example , the burning of the Koran .
and these huge soldiers with their back@@ packs and their body armor , wob@@ bled to the ground .
you don &apos;t believe me ?
and that became the headline of a Fortune article .
this has paid all the costs for the transformation of Interface .
ultimately , we now live in a world defined not by consumption , but by participation .
especially now , as we all must confront the fallacy of a marke@@ t-@@ only orientation , un@@ informed by social conscience ; we must seize and celebrate the power of the arts to shape our individual and national characters , and especially characters of the young people , who all too often , are subjected to bombar@@ d@@ ment of sensation , rather than dige@@ sted experience .
so this is &quot; Ob@@ li@@ vion &quot; by A@@ stor Pi@@ azz@@ olla .
he came up to me afterwards , he said , &quot; Man , that &apos;s a fabulous story .
in my business it &apos;s very difficult work .
then what happens is the retinal circuitry , the middle part , goes to work on it , and what it does is it performs operations on it , it extracts information from it , and it converts that information into a code .
so what it &apos;s doing is , it &apos;s replacing the retinal circuitry , really the guts of the retinal circuitry , with a set of equations , a set of equations that we can implement on a chip . so it &apos;s just math .
you have about 30,000 genes .
and what we found -- so this is now supposed to be , again , my bacterial cell -- is that Vibrio fischeri has a protein -- that &apos;s the red box -- it &apos;s an enzyme that makes that little hormone molecule , the red triangle .
so now what we understand is that all bacteria can talk to each other .
they make chemical words , they recognize those words , and they turn on group behaviors that are only successful when all of the cells participate in unison .
by targeting the red system , what we are able to do is to make species-specific , or disease-@@ specific , anti-@@ quorum sensing molecules .
it &apos;s a really lucky demographic to work with .
Ms : Warren , are you a golfer ?
but if fairness were the only thing at stake , there would have been an easy and obvious solution .
so better to shy away from , to ignore , the moral and the religious convictions that people bring to civic life .
CA : so , I would imagine that there are a lot of people who would love to join you in that endeavor .
the gerontology approach looks much more promising on the surface , because , you know , prevention is better than cure .
so , these trajectories here are basically how we would expect people to live , in terms of remaining life expectancy , as measured by their health , for given ages that they were at the time that these therapies arrive .
and of course , if you &apos;re a bit younger than that , then you &apos;re never really even going to get near to being fragile enough to die of age-related causes .
and thirdly , the question is , what will it do to actually how much people want it ?
I say that &apos;s nonsense .
so we like to see profits , plus positive social and environmental benefits , when we invest .
have you seen the incredible urge out there to rebuild the very things that failed us ?
this means that we have to focus on how our youth are going to be engaged in productive endeavor in their lives .
so now we have this platform we can build on .
so I was the oldest person in the house .
why am I telling that ? I &apos;m telling you that because -- when it is you or your person involved -- you don &apos;t care where -- whether it &apos;s aid .
what has happened in Europe ?
how can we get government to combine properly with these private foundations , with the international organizations , and with our private sector .
so we can make a catalytic to help us provide some of that .
one idea .
and so why don &apos;t we go and click the video .
and so I set out with this concept , scientifically , that artistic creativity , it &apos;s magical , but it &apos;s not magic , meaning that it &apos;s a product of the brain .
now the way that &apos;s done is by the following .
CL : okay , so it works .
and so the next question was : what happens when musicians are trading back and forth , something called &quot; trading fours , &quot; which is something they do normally in a jazz experiment ?
this is an area thought to be involved in expressive communication .
but if it &apos;s taught properly , it can be a lot of fun .
Evan . okay .
he just hangs out . he &apos;s relaxed .
the two are related because the profit actually takes long enough that if it isn &apos;t fun , you wouldn &apos;t have the time to do it .
so we do this fun and profit-@@ oriented inventing for most of what we do , but we also have a program where we invent for humanity -- where we take some of our best inventors , and we say , &quot; Are there problems where we have a good idea for solving a problem the world has ? &quot; -- and to solve it in the way we try to solve problems , which is with dramatic , crazy , out-of-the-box solutions .
so what can we do about it ?
we also try to study our fo@@ e .
well , we could protect very high-@@ value targets like clinics .
and farmers could protect their crops that they want to sell to Whole Foods because our photons are 100 percent organic .
so this system that was built for TED is here to illustrate that it is technically possible to actually deploy a system like this , and we &apos;re looking very hard at how to make it highly cost-effective to use in places like Africa and other parts of the world .
this is one of the first ones we did .
it &apos;s then sold and bought , and it &apos;s then delivered to me .
I think that there are many problems to come , but with help , I &apos;m sure I &apos;m going to find solutions .
so if I live to see 80 years of age , I &apos;m going to have a five-@@ hour video that encapsul@@ ates 50 years of my life .
they &apos;re not even enjoying the show .
I think philosophically , that was one of the most important papers that we &apos;ve ever done because it showed how dynamic life was .
it turned out the cell that we were trying to transplant into had a nuc@@ lease , an enzyme that che@@ ws up DNA on its surface , and was happy to eat the synthetic DNA that we gave it and never got trans@@ plantations .
but at the time , that was the largest molecule of a defined structure that had been made .
so when you see how long it took to get an H1N1 vaccine out , we think we can shor@@ ten that process quite substantially .
those are just a couple of the approaches and directions that we &apos;re taking .
so this past spring , as I was ge@@ aring up to begin writing a biography of Muhammad , I realized I needed to read the Koran properly -- as properly as I could , that is .
I did resist the temptation to skip to the back where the shorter and more clearly mystical chapters are .
and this shows a recently virgin queen . here &apos;s her wings .
so this is the colony founded by a queen the previous summer .
the queen &apos;s in there somewhere ; she just lays eggs .
so I did experiments where I changed one thing .
so , for example , when there &apos;s extra nest maintenance work to do , it &apos;s not that the foragers switch over . I know that they don &apos;t do that .
but the foragers somehow decide not to come out .
we &apos;ve had a digital revolution but we don &apos;t need to keep having it .
so this is the next step from there to here , and this is getting commercialized today .
this student &apos;s made an alarm clock you wrestle to prove you &apos;re awake ; this is one that def@@ ends -- a dress that def@@ ends your personal space .
this is a device that lets you see your music .
and I finally got what &apos;s been going on . this is Ker@@ ni@@ gan and Ritchie inventing UNI@@ X on a P@@ DP .
so where are we headed from here ?
you take eight million trucks -- these are 18-@@ wheelers -- and take them to natural gas , reduce carbon by 30 percent , it is cheaper and it will cut our imports three million barrels .
but when you look at the natural gas we have it could very well be the bridge to natural gas , because you have plenty of natural gas .
and so the margin is natural gas .
where are we headed ? &quot;
see but again , I told you , I don &apos;t have to worry with that .
TBP : no , let me tell you , I &apos;ve told you what my age was .
I mean seriously , the Department of Energy did not have anything to do with fracking .
I saw my first one in &apos; 53 .
and I say , that is your problem .
huge boom . huge boom . huge bust . huge bust .
they turned the ships into hotels , because they couldn &apos;t sail them anywhere .
so all of the cab@@ ling and all of the heavy infrastructure -- I &apos;m going back now to , sort of , the explosive part of the Web in 1994 , when it was growing 2,300 percent a year .
so we &apos;re not -- we &apos;re pretty klu@@ d@@ ge-@@ y ourselves .
I want to warn you about that .
I don &apos;t quite mean that the golden rule itself is written in our genes , but you can go to a hunter gather@@ er society that has had no exposure to any of the great religious traditions , no exposure to ethical philosophy , and you &apos;ll find , if you spend time with these people , that , basically , they believe that one good turn deserves another , and that bad deeds should be punished .
with zero-sum channels you would expect something else .
in Oxford in the 1950s , there was a fantastic doctor , who was very unusual , named Alice Stewart .
well , for the most part , they don &apos;t .
but he kept worrying about it , and he worried about it so much that he got to the point where he thought the only thing he could do was leave a job he loved .
and then , how about a mem@@ en@@ to ? number seven .
the stone itself is absolutely beautiful , sculpted by millennia of very tough w@@ inters up there .
and shale is not quite completely competent rock .
that &apos;s Ben Rober@@ ts from -- he &apos;s the bat specialist from the National Park .
now , as you gain elevation your IQ goes down -- but your emotional affect goes up , which is great for having a mythic experience , whether you want to or not .
I &apos;m saying , &quot; Be careful , be careful , be careful . &quot;
now , if you go over to the right from this image to looking at the edge of the cliffs , it &apos;s 600 foot , just about a yard to the left of Kurt B@@ oll@@ acker &apos;s foot , there is a 60@@ 0-@@ foot drop . he &apos;s am@@ bling on over to Zander &apos;s Siq .
you &apos;d have a polished set of passages and chambers in there eventually leading to the 10,000 year clock .
I have , like , a thing about sleeping .
so that &apos;s what I do . I study color a lot .
so , you know , for years I would go to bars and , sort of , anyone I met whose name was Eric I was hum@@ ping immediately , or something .
and if you &apos;re not , you have to pretend to be slightly bored with everything .
I always say to my partner , Mar@@ isa Gar@@ dini , who books everything -- she books everything and she makes everything happen .
I always relate things to kitch@@ en-@@ ry .
we actually shoot segments like T.V. show segments .
IM : yeah , exactly .
and that &apos;s what it was in the early days .
and that &apos;s what people used for baking and all sorts of things .
this Nigerian student studied in London , trained in Yemen , boar@@ ded a flight in Amsterdam to attack America .
not to put too fine a point on it , the moment we &apos;re living through -- the moment our historical generation is living through -- is the largest increase in expressive capability in human history .
and because of those four characteristics they are able to filter it as it comes into the country .
they had to turn the spigot entirely off .
very expensive to do , so there is not a lot of competition .
I remember one time being up near the summit , I reached into my down jacket for a drink from my water bottle , inside my down jacket , only to discover that the water was already frozen solid .
we were in radio contact with some of them .
we were just hun@@ k@@ ered down in our tents at Camp Three .
apparently , Doug had died higher up on the mountain .
Rob then signed off , and that was the last we ever heard of him .
and then he said , &quot; Do you accept my health insurance ? &quot;
OK , but he &apos;s losing ground here .
he &apos;s running out of energy .
and I believe this change in the mindset , of looking at people as something of a burden to human capital , has been one of the fundamental changes in the Indian mindset .
one is in the south and in the west of India , which is already going to be fully expen@@ sed by 2015 , because in that part of the country , the fertility rate is almost equal to that of a West European country .
and that is a change in the mindset where infrastructure is now accepted .
now why does this matter to you ?
because you know what to do about the protests .
in a small country that could be my country , but could be also your country , they took a decision -- it is a real case story -- that all of the governmental decisions , discussions of the council of ministers , were going to be published on the Internet 24 hours after the council discussions took place .
gave them about a nine minute response , and there we went .
mm : I support George Bush . we &apos;re not there for the oil .
I should really thank God for saving my lucky ass .
two and a half million cars worth of gypsum , you know , CO2 generated . right ?
we need to reach a target inside the brain .
he said , &quot; Mir@@ ac@@ ulous . &quot;
all those tumors have heavy bleeding during periods , abdominal pressure , back pain , frequent ur@@ ination .
Johanna Blakley : lessons from fashion &apos;s free culture
they can take any element from any garment from the history of fashion and incorporate it into their own design .
but even sometimes a cheaper version can actually have some charming aspects , can breathe a little extra life into a dying trend .
Rachel Sus@@ sman : the world &apos;s oldest living things
what looks like mos@@ s covering rocks is actually a sh@@ rub comprised of thousands of branches , each containing clusters of tiny green leaves at the end and so densely packed together that you could actually stand on top of it .
and then , you might have heard of this giant clam that was discovered off the coast of northern Iceland that reached 40@@ 5 years old .
the tree can easily recover .
they talk about wanting lives of purpose and greater meaning .
and they wanted to celebrate what &apos;s beautiful about Kibera and Mathare -- the photo@@ journalists and the crea@@ tives , the graffiti artists , the teachers and the entrepreneurs .
and he said , &quot; Well , what are you praying ? &quot;
but no faces ?
so let &apos;s try to find them .
if we were to assay her perceptual abilities , they would be crude .
the sound doesn &apos;t have to be valuable to the animal : I could raise the animal in something that could be hypothe@@ tically valuable , like the sounds that simulate the sounds of a native language of a child .
so here is a very simple experiment .
and that is an unknown -- un@@ suspected , maybe , by you -- part of acquiring the skill or ability .
a way to think about this is you can actually re-@@ refine the processing capacity of the machinery by changing it .
this is like an IQ test for language .
and in older age conditions like Par@@ kin@@ son@@ ism , and in other acquired impairments like schizophrenia .
A@@ run@@ ach@@ al@@ am Mur@@ uganantham : how I started a sanitary napkin revolution !
it makes me to stand here , the fame , the money I got out of it .
the very first time , at the age of 29 , that day I am touching the sanitary pad , first ever .
then I thought to myself , white substance , made of cotton -- oh my God , that guy is just using a penny value of raw material -- inside they are selling for pounds , dollars .
am : and previously , you need a multim@@ illion investment for machine and all . now , any rural woman can .
he went to a local hospital and there they said , &quot; R@@ an , there is no possibility of us being able to save these fingers .
and equally , when it comes to climate change , every single country is going to have to make cuts .
all of us together , we &apos;re all on the same ship together .
the second thing we need to do is we need to just look back at how far we have come in such a short period of time .
we &apos;ve come a long way . we &apos;re doing good .
I &apos;ll try to spin a story about energy , and oil &apos;s a convenient starting place .
now , millions of abalone every year make this shell .
here &apos;s me and my dad a couple days after I was born .
we killed thousands of Post-it notes .
so the idea here is we say , you want to make it hard to use wrong .
and so what I &apos;m going to do is , not so much give you the great hits of that program , as to give you this whole notion of how you encounter people in that kind of situation , what you try to find out about them , and when people deliver and when they don &apos;t and why .
she was editor of V@@ anity Fair , one of the great phenomenal women of her day .
and I asked him one question .
and so she spent almost all of her life in bed , but -- I speak of the life force -- her hair was as@@ kew .
this is why we have set up the governance school and the Center for Civil Society here in Berlin , because we believe most of our educational and research institutions in Germany and continental Europe in general , do not focus enough , yet , on empowering civil society and training the leadership of civil society .
and so we were always caught in this stereotype .
Saint Ob@@ i : I was so fascinated , you know , with those cowboy movies .
now , if you saw a picture of this as it was published in Architec@@ tural Rec@@ ord -- they didn &apos;t show the context , so you would think , &quot; God , what a pu@@ shy guy this is . &quot;
he was the Swiss Army knife .
but we were trying to collide our ideas , to put objects next to each other .
the health club is fa@@ st@@ ened to the garage with a C-@@ clamp , for Cleveland .
the dome was a request from the client .
and the idea was to make this express the energy of this .
I know I &apos;m over time .
and it &apos;s not a great building , but I approached it optimistically , that we would make a compositional relationship between us that would strengthen both of us .
I find this shocking and somewhat appalling .
it &apos;s not that people are ignorant to the environmental damage .
and then we have the sensual factor of the face .
it &apos;s the face where we &apos;re attracted to with that .
you &apos;re looking at the image on your left-hand side -- that &apos;s my son with his eyebrows present .
they &apos;ve grown used to their face ; they think they &apos;re special .
people were making mis@@ judgments all the time on her mood .
is this change , though , a real change , or is it a fig@@ ment of the imagination of the patient themselves ?
now we know that he &apos;s a convicted wi@@ fe@@ -@@ batter@@ er , and actually he &apos;s not the good guy .
we put it in place so we knew it was an accurate position .
however , his chin skin doesn &apos;t look the same as it did before .
they have an increased risk of infection , an increased risk of malign@@ ancy .
we also don &apos;t know what they feel about recognition and identity .
donors are going to be short on the ground , because how many people want to have their loved one &apos;s face removed at the point of death ?
everyone says it couldn &apos;t be done .
the only working piece of equipment in my kitchen was a can cru@@ sher , because if it didn &apos;t come in a can , it came frozen in a box .
in this country , we &apos;re spending 110 billion dollars a year on fast food .
so you know what , when we talk about needing 8 billion more , it &apos;s not a lot .
it organizes itself .
you don &apos;t plan the details , and people will figure out what to do , how to adapt to this new framework .
and the other question , who changed their mind ?
I went in for the CAT scan , and it turns out there were five of these things in both my lungs .
and I thought , &quot; You know , I wonder what my sole@@ us muscle is ? &quot;
and I thought , &quot; Why not take this and connect it to my digital scan data and have Google Earth for my body ? &quot;
but you see , it &apos;s still generic .
they worked out they were worth two billion pounds .
and in my little corner of the world , these two things are actually related , and I want to tell you how tonight .
a lexicon is a body of words that describes a domain .
I can think of a million uses for a tool like this .
fourteen years ago , I first encountered this ordinary material , fish@@ net , used the same way for centuries .
I continued studying craft traditions and collaborating with arti@@ s@@ ans , next in Li@@ thu@@ ania with lace makers .
now it had a sense of place .
so we had to create it .
my artistic horizons continue to grow .
looking at 30 billion per year , we look at our two largest suppliers , Saudi Arabia and now Canada , with its dirty oil .
and one thing to notice is that perhaps there are states of human well-being that we rarely access , that few people access .
and just admitting this -- just admitting that there are right and wrong answers to the question of how humans flourish -- will change the way we talk about morality , and will change our expectations of human cooperation in the future .
is there any doubt that this question has an answer , and that it matters ?
does not tempt us to say that there are no truths to be known about human nutrition .
let &apos;s have a look at that .
and there is another example : aphids .
how can we bridge , or let &apos;s say , narrow , this gap in the course of the years ?
this was one of a series called &quot; Z@@ any Af@@ ter@@ no@@ ons , &quot; which became a book .
what about ourselves ?
so they ended up an Iron Age European society , virtually unable to make their own iron . a second item on my checklist is climate change . climate can get warmer or colder or dryer or we@@ tter .
long-@@ held devotion to logging and to mines and to agriculture , and to no government regulation ; values that worked well in the past , but they don &apos;t seem to be working well today .
and the other generalization that I want to mention is that it &apos;s particularly hard for a society to make quot@@ e-@@ unquote good decisions when there is a conflict involving strongly held values that are good in many circumstances but are poor in other circumstances . for example , the Greenland Norse , in this difficult environment , were held together for four@@ -and-a-half centuries by their shared commitment to religion , and by their strong social co@@ hesion . but those two things -- commitment to religion and strong social co@@ hesion -- also made it difficult for them to change at the end and to learn from the Inuit . or today -- Australia .
but this is quite good .
it &apos;s 25 kilograms per person per year .
each point on the surface of the sphere is mapped through the bottom pole , onto a flat surface , where it is then recorded .
what you &apos;re doing is you really swing your leg and catch the fall , stand up again , swing your leg and catch the fall .
the problem that we had with STriDER I is it was just too heavy in the body . we had so many motors , you know , aligning the joints , and those kinds of things .
and so , 4 am in the morning , what do you expect , right ?
I guarantee if you come to your lab at 3 - 4 am we have students working there , not because I tell them to , but because we are having too much fun .
now , this perfect storm that we are facing is the result of our rising population , rising towards 10 billion people , land that is turning to desert , and , of course , climate change .
now let &apos;s go to our land nearby on the same day , with the same rainfall , and look at that .
the man in the middle is an Argent@@ inian researcher , and he has documented the steady decline of that land over the years as they kept reducing sheep numbers .
and when I say we , I mean Project H , but more specifically , I mean myself and my partner , Matthew Miller , who &apos;s an architect and a sort of Mac@@ Gy@@ ver@@ -type builder .
and this was for a fund that the school district had to put a desktop computer and a broadband Internet connection in every home with a child in the public school system .
so I want you to meet three of our students .
the birth of the idea is from David Hu@@ bel and Tor@@ sten Wi@@ e@@ sel &apos;s work , two researchers who were at Harvard , and they got the Nobel Prize in 1981 for their studies of visual physiology , which are remarkably beautiful studies , but I believe some of their work has been extrapol@@ ated into the human domain prematurely .
am : well , for those of you who have seen the picture in the little bio -- it might have given it away -- I &apos;m a double ampu@@ tee , and I was born without fi@@ bul@@ as in both legs .
that &apos;s all I wanted -- just two practices .
and putting on my Georgetown uniform and going out there and knowing that , you know , in order to become better -- and I &apos;m already the best in the country -- you know , you have to train with people who are inherently better than you .
it was , like , this is my time for shine .
here we are , like , cr@@ è@@ me de la cr@@ è@@ me , and there is no doubt about it , that I &apos;m going to lose big .
and it made me really think about how the achievement was getting there .
and let &apos;s understand : this is not an incremental sort of change .
it &apos;s like the land and the king they &apos;re in@@ separ@@ able , they are one .
they don &apos;t understand real world space .
it projects down digital shadows , as you see here .
and , of course , it &apos;s not just about navigation , but about manipulation as well .
and one thing that &apos;s very important is to combine traditional tab@@ ular data with three-dimensional and ge@@ os@@ pati@@ al information .
Ju : it &apos;s been a great pleasure .
I thought I &apos;d tell you a little about what I like to write .
you donate money to a cause , and you become emotionally involved in that cause .
should we view it , you know , as original intent , like a sort of a Sc@@ alia version of the Bible ?
it &apos;s a very relaxing vocation . I recommend it .
you &apos;re just picking and choosing . &quot;
Ushahidi -- the name means &quot; witness &quot; or &quot; testimony &quot; in Swahili -- is a very simple way of taking reports from the field , whether it &apos;s from the web or , critically , via mobile phones and SMS , aggregating it and putting it on a map .
and deter@@ rence theory is a very simple theory of human behavior : if you want somebody to do less of something , add a punishment and they &apos;ll do less of it .
England invented 20 overs cricket , and said , &quot; The world must play 20 overs cricket . &quot;
we got to the final , and then this moment , that will remain enshrined forever , for everybody , take a look .
I mean the I@@ PL had 2.3 billion dollars before a ball was bow@@ led , 1.6 billion dollars for television revenue over 10 years , and another 70 million dollars plus from all these franch@@ ises that were putting in money . and then they had to appeal to their cities , but they had to do it like the West , right ? because we are setting up leagues .
calculating odds would seem to be something rather easy : there are six sides to a die , two sides to a coin , 52 cards in a deck .
now , the question I &apos;m going to put to you is whether you think there are more dogs or pigs on leashes observed in any particular day in Oxford .
we see this on TV ; we read about it in the paper .
but in fact , to decide whether a Big Mac is worth 25 dollars requires that you ask one , and only one question , which is : what else can I do with 25 dollars ?
suddenly , we &apos;re almost longing for him to return .
here &apos;s why that &apos;s a problem : the problem is that when you get that $ 33 bottle of wine home , it won &apos;t matter what it used to be sitting on the shelf next to .
let me just give you an example .
because this 100 dollars that you save -- hello ! -- doesn &apos;t know where it came from .
what you see here are two lads , one of them larger than the other : the fireman and the fiddler .
at no point will the fireman look taller than the fiddler . no point .
Bernoulli &apos;s gift , Bernoulli &apos;s little formula , allows us , it tells us how we should think in a world for which nature never designed us .
you might say that the theme is nature and everything that follows is a variation on the subject .
Who@@ ops ! passed each other .
do you think this sort of thing could really attract a student to the school ? &quot;
that poster is not folded .
but this , for me , I mean , coming here to do this , feels like -- there &apos;s this sculptor that I like very much , Giacometti , who after many years of living in France -- and learning , you know , studying and working -- he returned home and he was asked , what did you produce ?
woman : have you ever been ?
Marcus : so what do you talk about ?
there &apos;s a young director , Hollywood director , with his friends -- fellow filmmakers -- talking about what cinema means .
O@@ nic@@ ha : yes , mama .
there was no food , just little rice .
you too are a retired General , not so ?
you are not on trial .
and I told her the Frank Lloyd Wright story .
so we like pointing out the fact that we &apos;re smart .
the good news about Holly though is that she doesn &apos;t actually have the same kinds of technologies we do .
this is A and B are kind of the points where she &apos;s sort of a little bit curious about these things -- doesn &apos;t know .
so not just Honey , most of the monkeys went with guys who had more .
one possibility is just kind of let the monkey financial system play out , you know , see if they start calling us for bailouts in a few years .
we were a little impatient so we wanted to sort of speed things up a bit .
people are a little risk-averse . so what ?
perhaps it was like these toddler rules : it &apos;s my stuff if I saw it first .
people , for as little as a dollar a day , pick through our stuff .
and they extract the metals by hand .
and not just sustainable from an environmental standpoint , sustainable from an economic standpoint as well .
well a good place to start is with waste .
so originally I was going to go to India .
so they bring them in from the country and put them up in the dor@@ ms .
this is going to show you , real time , an assem@@ bler . it &apos;s a circuit breaker .
it just gives you a sense of , again -- and that &apos;s where , really , the whole migration of jobs started going over to China and making the shoes . Nike was one of the early ones .
I think mobile phone companies are popping up , literally , on a weekly basis , and they have an explosive growth in mobile phones .
and so one could be for the best sustainable idea for an in-@@ school project , the best one for a household project , or it could be the best community project for sustainability .
they are our family . &quot;
now , as a preacher , I got a job . I got to preach the stuff , but I got to do it too .
I think maybe it &apos;s one time when the Bible talks about a healthcare system and a commitment to do whatever is necessary -- that all God &apos;s children would have their needs cared for , so that we could answer when mommy eternal asks , &quot; In regards to health , are all the children in ? &quot; and we could say yes .
the reason it &apos;s important is because this is a very special time in history .
so in order to do that , I founded a charter called Gu@@ a Africa , where we put kids in school .
they had to fit two criteria : they had to be old enough to be able to understand the whole concept of the age of reason , and not yet seven .
but , Julie , you were so ready to start school , honey . you were so ready . &quot;
and they said , &quot; Yes . &quot;
and actually , social scientists have already gone out and asked these questions around the world .
we all have one planet . we all have to share it .
now , there &apos;s a huge array of nations around that global average .
that &apos;s what we need to do .
we did a project for the Government Office of Science a couple of years ago , a big program called the Fo@@ resi@@ ght program -- lots and lots of people -- involved lots of experts -- everything evidence based -- a huge tome .
and then I believe that we can all create a world we all want , where happiness does not cost the earth .
but nothing , nothing prepared me for what I was to hear on the first of July 2008 .
they had all sorts of different data formats , all sorts , all kinds of documentation systems .
so that , in all that diversity , if I wanted to figure out how to build something out of a bit of this and a bit of this , everything I looked into , I had to connect to some new machine , I had to learn to run some new program , I would find the information I wanted in some new data format .
well , documents you read , OK ?
one of the great -- yes a lot of people have seen it -- one of the great TED Tal@@ ks .
third rule is that when I get back that information it &apos;s not just got somebody &apos;s height and weight and when they were born , it &apos;s got relationships .
so if you pull the data from d@@ b@@ pedia about Berlin , you &apos;ll end up pulling up these other things as well .
that &apos;s important . why is it important ?
you hug your database , you don &apos;t want to let it go until you &apos;ve made a beautiful website for it .
and all the people -- and I think there &apos;s a lot of people at TED who do things because -- even though there &apos;s not an immediate return on the investment because it will only really pay off when everybody else has done it -- they &apos;ll do it because they &apos;re the sort of person who just does things which would be good if everybody else did them .
and the simple fact is , if we are focused on ourselves , if we &apos;re preoccupied , as we so often are throughout the day , we don &apos;t really fully notice the other .
so my brother-in-law goes to interview this killer and he realizes when he meets him that this guy is absolutely terrifying .
and I think that that is very troubling , and in a sense , I &apos;ve been reflecting on turning that part of us off .
Richard Branson : thank you very much . the first TED has been great .
RB : well , I think that there &apos;s a very thin dividing line between success and failure .
when I first came to America , I used to try this with employees as well and they kind of -- they have these different rules over here , it &apos;s very strange .
RB : many times .
RB : no , he told me jump , but once his weight had gone , the balloon just shot up to 12,000 feet and I ...
and wrote some notes to my family . and then climbed back up again , looked down at those clouds again , climbed back into the capsule again .
RB : so , when I turned 50 , somebody took me outside the boardroom and said , &quot; Look Richard , here &apos;s a -- let me draw on a diagram .
CA : the war room sounds , it sounds powerful and dramatic .
they said , &quot; Of course .
and this was collected by An@@ ap@@ um -- which is like , finally in the end , he will not have anything , because it will evaporate .
it &apos;s in the same gallery or in the same museum .
the skin of this is also representing this .
physics and marketing don &apos;t seem to have much in common , but Dan C@@ ob@@ ley is passionate about both . he brings these unlikely bed@@ fellows together using Newton &apos;s second law , He@@ is@@ enberg &apos;s uncertainty principle , the scientific method and the second law of thermodynamics to explain the fundamental theories of branding .
but if we rearrange this formula quickly , we can get to acceleration equals force over mass , which means that for a larger particle -- a larger mass -- it requires more force to change its direction .
the act of observation changes it .
but actually , it &apos;s a drive . it comes from the motor of the mind , the wanting part of the mind , the craving part of the mind .
and I think that attachment , the third brain system , evolved to enable you to tolerate this human being -- -- at least long enough to raise a child together as a team .
with the beginning of plow agriculture , men &apos;s roles became extremely powerful .
I know one girl who &apos;s been on these antidepressants , seroton@@ in-@@ enhancing -- S@@ SR@@ I , seroton@@ in-@@ enhancing antidepressants -- since she was 13 .
and the good news is today we are tackling the big issues , of cars and the environment -- not only at Ford , but really as an industry .
I &apos;ll play this until your eyeballs completely dissolve .
he just lay in the hospital bed , and , kind of , stared at the poly@@ sty@@ rene ceiling tiles for a really long time .
and I think that &apos;s really , really important .
it &apos;s been all about these kind of thou@@ ght@@ less things that people do , which have huge intention and huge opportunity .
last section : green arm@@ band . we &apos;ve all got them .
so as a final gesture we handed out these bracelets to all of you this morning .
when children are empowered , not only do they do good , they do well , in fact very well , as you can see in this national bench@@ marking assessment taken by over 2,000 schools in India , Riverside children were out@@ performing the top 10 schools in India in math , English and science .
and they did . stories of change poured in from all over India , from N@@ ag@@ aland in the east , to J@@ hun@@ j@@ hun@@ u in the west , from Si@@ k@@ ki@@ m in the north , to Kri@@ shn@@ ag@@ ir@@ i in the south .
and what is interesting is that this is hugely popular by the people who use it .
and you can measure the performance , in terms of energy consumption , of that building against a typical library .
look at this picture .
this person , whom we met -- and you will see it on the website , www.@@ s@@ ri@@ sti@@ .org -- this tribal person , he had a wish .
Kab@@ ir , Ra@@ him , all the great Sufi saints , they were all poor people , and they had a great reason .
but he has modified a two-wheeler so that he can get autonomy and freedom and flexibility .
no , we have to have the humility to learn from knowledge of economically poor people , wherever they are .
he said , &quot; I can &apos;t . this is the only thing I know , but I &apos;ll invent a machine , which will solve your problem . &quot;
so this is how we normally would light our offices .
and it &apos;s just a bit bright up there , so these people have found a very intriguing solution .
and they really practice what they preach because this office doesn &apos;t have any electric lighting at all .
and I guess that is something that Richard Kelly , here on the left , was explaining to Lu@@ d@@ wig M@@ ies Van der Ro@@ he .
so light is , of course , for social interaction also -- to create relationships with all the features around us .
and we can actually leave it out where it &apos;s not needed at all and where we can preserve darkness .
so just to explain .
they are not disturbed anymore .
I love them all . I don &apos;t keep any of them in my living room .
and she comes back to me and she stops , and she says , &quot; Fin@@ ally , they made something for us . &quot;
I &apos;m thinking , &quot; Wow , that was great -- -- please lady , don &apos;t say another word . &quot;
then she looks up , she &apos;s looking up , and she says , &quot; And I &apos;m 81 years old , and I don &apos;t drive a car anymore .
not much has changed .
but also it &apos;s part of being any monthly magazine -- you live in the future . and we have a long lead@@ -@@ time .
the next phase it hit was displacement .
it is abundance , as opposed to scarcity .
and so many low-income people have seen so many failed promises broken and seen so many qu@@ acks and sporadic medicines offered to them that building trust takes a lot of time , takes a lot of patience .
and he used three fundamental principles .
and he said it was the first dry season in his entire life that he hadn &apos;t taken his 12 children and 50 grandchildren on a two day journey across the desert to work as day laborers at a commercial farm for about 50 cents a day .
and it will take living with the spirit of generosity and accountability , with a sense of integrity and perseverance .
but there are blogs that are changing the way we read news and consume media , and , you know , these are great examples . these people are reaching thousands , if not millions , of readers , and that &apos;s incredibly important .
it &apos;s a wonderful organization of people and doctors who go to developing nations to offer plastic surgery to those who need it .
because the joke in this is that this person is not a tyrant : this person is so loving and so sweet that he lets me dress him up and post pictures of him to my blog .
and why are they reading this ? &quot;
so what ? you &apos;ve probably heard these things before .
and that was amazing -- to be able to know that we had empowered that , and that blogging was something that she felt comfortable doing , and that the idea that blogging doesn &apos;t have to be scary , that we don &apos;t always have to be attack of the blogs , that we can be people who are open , and wanting to help and talk to people .
this fish was revered by humankind .
now bluefin , in general , goes to one place : Japan .
these animals and their demise occurs in the tuna fisheries .
these tags have been engineered by a variety of teams in North America .
one community in general has given more to help us than any other community .
this tuna is actually moving on a numerical ocean .
this model , a model of overlap , is the way to move forward .
it &apos;s a free swimming shark with a satellite tag jumping after salmon , sending home its data .
this was in T@@ amp@@ a , Florida , so I was like , &quot; Winter clothes that I have no use for in Florida .
so in a way , I &apos;m glad that I &apos;m completely obsolete .
and I &apos;m glad that we have pat@@ rons of the arts in these fields .
it contains whether kids can talk to their parents , whether they have books at home , what immunization rates are like , whether there &apos;s bullying at school .
and at the more unequal end , fathers &apos; income is much more important -- in the U.K. , USA .
I think I &apos;m looking and talking about the psychosocial effects of inequality .
otherwise that would introduce bias .
contrary to what most people think , people don &apos;t pay , taxpayers don &apos;t pay , for your life when you &apos;re in prison . you &apos;ve got to pay for your own life .
it &apos;s a delight to use .
it actually affects the way the brain works .
I &apos;m going to talk about children and self-organization , and a set of experiments which sort of led to this idea of what might an alternative education be like .
just a quick idea of the measurements .
basic Windows functions , browsing , painting , chatting and email , games and educational material , music downloads , playing video .
I headed the Middle East Peace Pro@@ cess section in the British Foreign Ministry .
I was the chief British negoti@@ ator on the subject , and I was steeped in the issue .
I negotiated for my country the resolution in the Security Council of the 12th of September 2001 condemning the attacks of the day before , which were , of course , deeply present to us actually living in New York at the time .
there were diplomatic negotiations about the future of Kosovo going on then , and the Kosovo government , let alone the Kosovo people , were not actually participating in those talks .
it was a complicated thing , and I &apos;m not pretending it was more simple than it was .
that was the origin of the thing that became Independent Diplomat , the world &apos;s first diplomatic advi@@ sory group and a non-profit to boot .
independent Diplomat ended up advising three successive Kosovo prime ministers and the multi-@@ party negotiation team of Kosovo .
the Security Council does its business in exactly the same way today that it did X number of years ago , when I was there 10 years ago .
and of course , describing all this , any of you who know politics will think this is incredibly difficult , and I entirely agree with you .
here , this clo@@ aked , secret agent virus is slipping his DNA into the bacterial cell , but here &apos;s the kick@@ er : it doesn &apos;t do anything harmful -- not at first .
and now all of you understand it .
whether or not you &apos;re in my business , you have surely heard or read of the decline of the thing called the three-@@ camera sitcom and the rise of reality TV .
the 1980s , our first cou@@ gar was given to us in the form of Alexis Car@@ r@@ ington .
in 190@@ 2 , the great American psychologist William James wrote about the many varieties of religious experience .
previous to this time , I was very selfish and self-@@ righteous .
so many books about war say the same thing , that nothing brings people together like war .
it feels somehow uplifting .
in &quot; The Des@@ cent of Man , &quot; Charles Darwin wrote a great deal about the evolution of morality -- where did it come from , why do we have it .
it &apos;s about the eternal struggle between good and evil , and we all believe we &apos;re on the good team .
and that gives me hope because people are not purely selfish .
so , I am indeed going to talk about the spaces men create for themselves , but first I want to tell you why I &apos;m here .
and I found that there was an historic prece@@ dence .
in the popular culture , Superman had the For@@ tress of Sol@@ itude , and there was , of course , the Bat@@ cave .
I actually find them a lot more emotional -- -- and personal , and the neat thing about a slide projector is you can actually focus the work , unlike PowerPoint and some other programs .
so , this is from &quot; 2nd S@@ ight , &quot; a book I did on intuition .
and I remembered seeing this photograph of my father , who was a test pilot , and he told me that when you signed up to become a test pilot , they told you that there was a 40 to 50 percent chance of death on the job .
this is not on another planet . these are things that are hidden away on our planet .
so I took the great big 18@@ 95 Mon@@ t@@ g@@ om@@ ery Ward &apos;s catalog and I randomly went through it . and I took a page -- not quite a random page -- I took a page that was actually more difficult than others because lots of the pages are filled with things that are still being made . but I took this page and I said , how many of these things are still being made ?
all the things that we think that we really like about humanity is being driven by technology . this is the infinite game .
then he lifts another arm and I lift an arm .
it made scientists rethink where life on Earth might have actually begun .
there &apos;s no hot water .
look in your own backyard , in fact , look in the mirror .
two hundred years ago , the United States was less than a few percent urban@@ ized .
so the route in is recognizing one of the most extraordinary things about life , is that it is scalable , it works over an extraordinary range .
this is a bunch of software companies -- and what it is is their revenue versus their age -- all zooming away , and everybody making millions and billions of dollars .
but here &apos;s what &apos;s surprising .
and here , they &apos;re all plotted together .
the catch , however , to this is that you have to innovate faster and faster and faster .
so the image is that we &apos;re not only on a treadmill that &apos;s going faster , but we have to change the treadmill faster and faster .
and we do OK . insulin &apos;s a pretty good therapy .
however , for those of you that are even the slightest bit squeamish -- even though you may not like to admit it in front of your friends -- the lights are down . this is a good time to look at your feet , check your Blackberry , do anything other than look at the screen .
the treatment for this is amputation .
DARPA just gave Steve 15 million dollars to lead an eight-@@ institution project to begin the process of asking that question .
there are materials that do this . here are the heart patches .
a number of governments , and a number of regions , have recognized that this is a new way to treat disease .
I mean I know it &apos;s a real person and everything , but I &apos;m just saying that like , you know , I think it &apos;s very cool how it &apos;s also an acronym , you know , which is like , you know , is like very high concept and everything like that .
and usually my work , it takes me to Washington D.C .
my daughter -- my daughter wrote that , she told me , &quot; Al@@ ways start your speech with humor . &quot;
I want to hold your hand .
that &apos;s Mike , Mike comes out from Mississippi .
and we were doing open-heart surgery .
and guess what , if it all fails , if you can find a car that &apos;s still got a live battery and you stick it in , it will still work . then you can customize it .
it &apos;s what we call , &quot; In@@ vest , connect and celebrate . &quot;
so , in 2003 , I started to make my way around Los Angeles to talk about the idea of a pro-@@ social media company and I was met with a lot of encouragement .
and we don &apos;t just want people to see our movies and say , that was fun , and forget about it .
and that &apos;s me with Y@@ ous@@ s@@ ou N &apos;@@ D@@ our , onstage , having the time of my life .
so , I would like to say to you , each one in the audience , if you feel that every mother and every child in the world has the right to have access to good nutrition and good medical care , and you believe that the Millennium Development Goals , specifically five and six , should be absolutely committed to by all governments around the world -- especially in sub-Saharan Africa -- could you please stand up .
and here in the United Kingdom there &apos;s also concern over a law called the Digital Econ@@ omy Act that &apos;s placing more onus on private intermedi@@ aries to police citizen behavior .
these are grim economic times , fellow TEDsters , grim economic times indeed .
it &apos;s one of the tens of thousands of mom@@ -and-@@ pop grow@@ -@@ ops in B.C .
we sat in a car on the Avenue Pau@@ list@@ a in S@@ ã@@ o Paulo , together .
and these pills contain only low doses of the active ingredient .
and we got so over@@ heated in the chase that we had to take off that fur coat and throw it away .
you &apos;ve got this beautiful paradigm .
it &apos;s never been done .
they say &quot; Well ...
the professional journals won &apos;t touch it with a barge pole .
but he explained to me that he was in a bind , and that he was having trouble finding the kind of sex appeal and star power that the conference was known for -- so I said fine , Ted -- I mean Chris . I &apos;ll come on two conditions .
and two -- I want to pick the theme for TED 2006 .
the fund was deposited as a family reassure , in a safe , reliable security company in Da@@ kar , Senegal , where I was only given temporary asylum .
it &apos;s a letter .
so , here you go .
animals do displays . they do two things : they warn you or they try to attract you and say , &quot; We need to mate . &quot;
so this particular device is called the G@@ ut List@@ ener .
and this is the conversion of one group of substances into another , either through the production or the absorption of energy .
and that &apos;s the shell around that glo@@ bul@@ ar fat .
so , here is the technology we have today .
yet I still hadn &apos;t saved a single life .
but if compassion was fun , everybody &apos;s going to do it .
it &apos;s sort of a funny pattern .
it was two persons saying , &quot; Let &apos;s do this , &quot; and the company said , &quot; Yes . &quot;
we often think of torture as being political torture or reserved for just the worst , but , in fact , 95 percent of torture today is not for political prisoners .
the typeface -- the typeface is Helvetica ; it &apos;s its 50th anniversary this year .
and then they make a little tent for the baby .
it was about a new phase , in my opinion , in the world of design in that materials could be customized by the designers themselves .
I want to make this point by showing you two examples of design coming from a sense of economy -- very , very clear limits .
I didn &apos;t grow up in the slums or anything that dire , but I know what it is to grow up without having money , or being able to support family .
the first time he got sick , he recovered .
where do we go from here ?
and because of the opportunities that were afforded to me , I am able to lift all those people .
and he said , &quot; Look , you can get into Harvard , you &apos;re that good , OK ?
and she said , &quot; Well , I think it &apos;s too late . &quot;
she said , &quot; You &apos;re like the worst vulnerability role model ever . &quot;
but I want to talk about what I &apos;ve learned .
we &apos;d like you to come in and speak .
no , it is .
the thing to understand about shame is it &apos;s not guilt .
if shame washes over me and washes over Chris , it &apos;s going to feel the same .
I did not interview men for the first four years of my study .
if you put the same amount of shame in a Petri dish and dou@@ se it with empathy , it can &apos;t survive .
I think first it &apos;s important for us to recognize what it is to be blind .
and then we train about 50 ophthal@@ mologists against the 70 trained by them , comparable quality , both in training and in patient care .
you can &apos;t see it , but it &apos;s there . &quot;
the wheelchair became an object to paint and play with .
social capital in the slums is at its most urban and dense .
and you go to a nice dense place like this slum in Mumbai .
they &apos;re doing it through an outlaw thing , the informal economy .
it brings carrying capacity down , and there &apos;s not enough carrying capacity to support the people . and then you &apos;re in trouble .
coal is what is causing the climate problems .
because remember , this is what drives the prosperity in the developing world in the villages and in the cities .
I want to point out one interesting thing , which is that environmentalists like the thing we call micro@@ power .
at the very last minute , we are going to get saved just like in every Hollywood movie , just like in the Rap@@ ture .
there &apos;s this incredible complexity in the CPU , and this incredible regularity in the memory .
and there &apos;s not just one of these , there &apos;s many of them .
now , imagine these soi@@ re@@ es , all these great and good comes along .
both of these guys were coming from a mathematical perspective , but Turing told us something very important .
that &apos;s been done . the second is now the study of all of those plans to determine what to build .
before the 20@@ 30s happen , we &apos;ll have it .
I launched a project named Six B@@ illion O@@ thers .
DH : please stand up , Richard .
BF : OK , sorry .
Richard Wurman : can I say something ?
RW : do I get to hold them ?
BF : no , it &apos;s a hassle . traveling too much .
two years later , she comes back with stage three C ovarian cancer .
now this is probably a good thing , right ?
and so I urge you all to wake up and to tune in and to influence the genomic revolution that &apos;s happening all around you .
and ultimately -- and here &apos;s a picture of our bone marrow transplant survivors , who come together for a reunion each year at Stanford .
hopefully this technology will let us have more of these survivors in the future .
these particles must have just as much mass and energy as is carried in by the proton and anti-@@ proton .
this is called the Uni@@ fied Elec@@ tro@@ weak Model , and it was put together back in 1967 .
we can include the strong force by spreading out its two charge directions and plotting the charges of the force particles in quarks along these directions .
some of these particles are at the very limit of what we &apos;ve been able to reach with experiments .
but predicting how nature works is a very risky game .
and when you get large numbers of people living in land that is not that fertile , particularly when you cut down trees , and you leave the soil open to the wind for erosion , as desperate populations cut down more and more trees , so that they can try and grow food for themselves and their families , what &apos;s going to happen ? something &apos;s got to give .
we have this program in prisons as well .
people like this are the role models we need for young Africans .
she came up so excited , with her certificate . she was &#91; in &#93; Roots and Shoots .
upon educating myself a little further about plastics , I actually realized this was a bad thing .
so in looking at that , I also realized that I was really angry .
so we met in November 2002 , and Aicha will now tell you how that came about .
however , after a few failed prototypes , I finally came up with this , the Lifesaver bottle .
we &apos;re in the fine city of Oxford .
and you begin to see the alternative centers of power building up -- in China , of course , though my own guess is that China &apos;s ascent to greatness is not smooth .
and we will see increasingly that even we in the West will reach out , have to reach out , beyond the cozy circle of the Atlantic powers to make alliances with others if we want to get things done in the world .
note , that when we went into Libya , it was not good enough for the West to do it alone ; we had to bring others in .
at that time , the defense of my country was about one thing and one thing only : how strong was our army , how strong was our air force , how strong was our navy and how strong were our allies .
that was when the enemy was outside the walls .
there is what Doctor Oz tells us .
and then bring a team of experts in there to meth@@ odically go through exactly what these people do , to distill down the cross-cultural distil@@ lation .
and research shows that they would be years largely free of chronic disease , heart disease , cancer and diabetes .
Adventists also tend to hang out with other Adventists .
and on weekends he likes to put on the boards , throw up rooster tails .
instead , if your friend &apos;s idea of recreation is physical activity , bowling , or playing hockey , biking or gardening , if your friends drink a little , but not too much , and they eat right , and they &apos;re engaged , and they &apos;re trusting and trustworthy , that is going to have the biggest impact over time .
I want you to consider for a moment if you really don &apos;t want the distracted teenager behind you to know that you &apos;re braking , that you &apos;re coming to a dead stop .
well , we asked him why he wanted to go up and do this .
it &apos;s almost like that old recipe for chicken soup where you boil the chicken until the flavor is just gone .
they pass information to each other .
this is the FedEx delivery guy of the cell .
and hopefully we &apos;ll be able to use this to discover more truth , and more beauty .
the cat came and went through an open window in the van .
Mec@@ hai Vi@@ ra@@ va@@ id@@ ya : how Mr. Con@@ dom made Thailand a better place
now , when I was a young man -- 40 years ago , the country was very , very poor with lots and lots and lots of people living in poverty .
and finally , because Romo is an extension of me , I can express myself through his emotions .
so we can &apos;t wait to get you all robots , and we can &apos;t wait to see what you build .
I &apos;m here to tell you a few tales of passion .
in the last 20 years I have published a few books , but I have lived in anonymity until February of 2006 , when I carried the Olympic flag in the Winter Olympics in Italy .
that made me a celebrity . now people recognize me in M@@ acy &apos;s , and my grandchildren think that I &apos;m cool .
I looked like a refrigerator .
now , how can you have a deep tan and have no wrinkles ?
they are paid less than men for the same work if they &apos;re paid at all , and they remain vulnerable because they have no economic independence , and they are constantly threatened by exploitation , violence and abuse .
Carolyn Ste@@ el : how food shapes our cities
and if we look to the future , it &apos;s an unsustainable diet .
Utopia was actually a word that Thomas Moore used deliberately .
here , I deliberately chose this because it is a man buying a vegetable .
I &apos;d like youth to get a sense of the dynam@@ ism , the dynamic and challenge of a compassionate lifestyle .
so it becomes slightly three-dimensional .
and the pigeon is flying down above the Ap@@ pi@@ an Way here .
we need some energy that &apos;s going to allow that to activate , allow our parts to be able to fold up from the program .
it basically em@@ beds the most fundamental building block of computing , the digital logic gate , directly into your parts .
so they have all of the information embedded in them of what was constructed .
so each chain , or each element , wants to turn right or left .
I &apos;m pleased to announce that , along with colleagues at Stanford and Caltech and UC@@ SF , we &apos;re currently starting an initiative to explore biological dark matter for the existence of new forms of life .
now , the physics of the human brain could hardly be more unlike the physics of such a jet .
it must have occurred to Castro that he has the chance to do for Cuba what Deng Xiaoping did for China , but he doesn &apos;t have a Hong Kong there on the island in Cuba .
many of them totally get the notion of a special zone that people can opt into as a rule .
it reas@@ sem@@ bles its genome after this radiation burst in about 12 to 24 hours , after its chromosomes are literally blown apart .
we delayed the start of our experiments in 1999 until we completed a year-@@ and-a-half bio@@ ethical review as to whether we should try and make an artificial species .
they cannot wait . the others , of course , wait .
they didn &apos;t get in as much trouble . they were better students .
for some people it &apos;s only about what is in the immediate situation , what other people are doing and what you &apos;re feeling .
Reuters alone puts out three and a half million news stories a year .
okay , that was kind of cool .
and I can &apos;t tell you what it was like to see the first pictures of Titan &apos;s surface from the probe . and this is what we saw .
and that is what the Huygens probe landed in .
yet , most of you have probably never heard about them .
Israeli Man : the fence has , in fact , created a solution to terror .
news An@@ chor : the cla@@ shes over the fence continue .
Israeli Sol@@ dier : a nonviolent protest is not going to stop the &#91; unclear &#93; .
chanting : we can do it ! we can do it !
well , as a result , the way we think , the way we act , the way we communicate is from the outside in .
their competitors are all equally qualified to make all of these products .
the goal is not to do business with everybody who needs what you have .
then how come we &apos;ve never heard of Samuel Pierpont Langley ?
market conditions were fantastic .
I TiVo stuff on my piece of junk Time Warner DV@@ R all the time .
listen to politicians now , with their comprehensive 12-@@ point plans .
and it &apos;s those who start with &quot; why &quot; that have the ability to inspire those around them or find others who inspire them .
so we could show the firing rate of that neuron as a function of the animal &apos;s location .
so this predicts that sensing the distances and directions of boundaries around you -- extended buildings and so on -- is particularly important for the hippocampus .
in that case , we can see how where they think the flag had been changes as a function of how you change the shape and size of the environment .
I gave a talk like this in London a while back about this point . I said , as I say to all of you , I &apos;m on Facebook . friend me .
this is a photograph of a brave British soldier .
