U@@ r@@ um@@ qi , 1 Feb ( Xinhua ) -- Over the past few years , in order to promote nationality soli@@ dar@@ ity and safeguard social stability , Xinjiang &apos;s Yili has launched in a cre@@ ative way a &quot; face-to-face &quot; propaganda activity to let the people of all nationalities hear the voice of the party and government , and the activity has been warm@@ ly welcomed .
L@@ ocated in the country &apos;s nor@@ th@@ western b@@ order , Yili has served as an important window during the country &apos;s opening up to the outside world.@@ Since reform and opening up , Yili has developed the economy by a large margin and rapidly improv@@ ed the people &apos;s livelihood .
however , restricted by communications and telecomm@@ unication conditions , a vast number of farm@@ ers and herdsmen living in the re@@ mot@@ e mountain@@ ous areas and rural areas have been unable to accurately learn in a timely fashion the party &apos;s and state &apos;s principles and policies .
in order to change this situation , in 1997 , the Yili Prefecture CPC Committee took the lead in organizing and sending some 10,000 teach@@ ers , divided into various propaganda teams , deep into the rural and p@@ ast@@ or@@ al areas during the summer vac@@ ation to present the facts and reason things out for the masses .
in 1999 , on the basis of summing up experiences , they again extended the face-to-face propaganda activity from Yili Prefecture to A@@ le@@ ta@@ i and T@@ ac@@ heng ; increased the number of the propaganda team members to more than 1,@@ 200 &#91; as published &#93; ; held nearly 4@@ ,000 propaganda lectures in all , which were attended by as many as tens of thousands of people ; and attained such desired results as &quot; larger scale , longer d@@ uration , ric@@ her contents , and better results . &quot;
in order to ensure the propaganda standard , the Yili Autonomous Prefecture CPC Committee selected and transferred only those cadres with higher political quality , a higher policy and theoretical standard , and a stronger propaganda ability , who speak both the Han language and the ethnic languages concerned , as the propaganda team member@@ s.In accordance with such requirements , the prefectures and coun@@ ties ( or cities ) concerned also set up propaganda teams level by level , each with three or four members , and placed the personnel concerned under centr@@ alized training for five to seven days .
in order to coordinate with the propaganda activity , the autonomous prefecture authorities and prefecture authorities especially organized personnel to comp@@ ile and make the vi@@ de@@ ot@@ apes , cas@@ sett@@ es , pictures , and materials concerned in the U@@ y@@ ghu@@ r language , the K@@ az@@ a@@ k@@ h language , and the Han language .
it was learned that while carrying out the &quot; face-to-face &quot; propaganda activity , the propaganda team members mainly explained the party &apos;s and state &apos;s nationality policies , rural policies , and reli@@ gi@@ ous policies and public@@ ized the tremendous changes that had taken place in the local areas since reform and opening up.@@ E@@ ach year , they would re@@ v@@ ise the themes and key topics of the propaganda activity in light of outstanding problems during different perio@@ ds .
apart from conducting propaganda by holding the parents &apos; meetings , for@@ um@@ s , and discussions , as well as in other form@@ s , the propaganda teams also tried to make the propaganda activity as vivi@@ d and lively as possible for the masses , such as conducting propaganda at the B@@ az@@ h@@ a ( trade f@@ air ) , Aken singing and playing performances , sp@@ or@@ ts mee@@ ts , the@@ at@@ r@@ ical performances , knowledge cont@@ ests , and so on .
when giving a propaganda lecture at the G@@ eg@@ ang@@ ou Pasture in Huocheng County , the propaganda team concerned especially st@@ aged an Aken singing and playing perform@@ ance@@ .S@@ ome people had hur@@ ried to the scene from areas some 30 kilometers away one day before .
as the propaganda activity was conducted in a way welcomed by the masses and with the local re@@ alities fully taken into account , it received an enthusiastic response from the masses .
in many rural areas , the masses sat on the grassland , in the foot@@ b@@ all fields , or under the trees and conscientiously listened to the propaganda lectures .
while A@@ bu@@ lim@@ iti , deputy secretary general of the Yili Prefecture Administrative Office , was giving a propaganda lecture in a tow@@ nship in Yining County , it suddenly r@@ ained .
after listening to a propaganda lecture , given the strong atmosphere and appe@@ al of the propaganda activity , some people would even follow the propaganda team to other villages where they would listen to the same propaganda lecture again .
&quot; T@@ han@@ ks to this activity , we have heard about and watched a lot of things , including those we have never heard of or seen before .
we could easi@@ ly understand what they said and learn a lot of things from them , &quot; sighed the masses in Yining County and Huocheng County , who had listened to the lectures .
an old man from Sadikeweizi Village of Sadikeweizi Township in Yining County firmly held a propaganda team member by hand , asking him to go to his house to give a lecture to his chil@@ d@@ ren@@ .He said : &quot; if only you had come here to give us propaganda lectures two years before !
we &apos;@@ re ill@@ iter@@ ate , know very little , and cannot conv@@ ince the young people@@ .You &apos;@@ ve given a very good lecture@@ .You should come here more often in future . &quot;
Y@@ ib@@ ul@@ ay@@ in , a farm@@ er from Al@@ am@@ u@@ tu@@ ya Village of Ying@@ ye@@ er Township in Yining City , said : &quot; a country is just like a family and the government is just like a paren@@ t@@ .If the paren@@ t often teach@@ es his children , his children will make fe@@ w@@ er mistakes . &quot;
the enthusiasm displayed by the masses in listening to the propaganda lectures also surprised those who gave the lec@@ tu@@ res@@ .@@ A propaganda team member later rec@@ al@@ led : &quot; I was deeply im@@ pressed by the atmosphere when I saw several hundred people quietly and conscientiously listening to my lecture@@ .Th@@ us , I talked more and more and better and better .
Jin Y@@ ul@@ ong , secretary of the leading Party group of the Yili Prefecture F@@ arm Machinery Bureau , has also been greatly en@@ ligh@@ tened , saying : &quot; in the past , I served as a deputy coun@@ ty mag@@ i@@ str@@ ate for several years.@@ However , I never carried out such face-to-face propaganda and education among the grassroots masses .
later on , when I saw our propaganda team welcomed by the masses where@@ ver it went and a large number of people coming to listen to our propaganda lectures , I myself was greatly educ@@ ated .
while carrying out the propaganda activity , the propaganda team members displayed a spirit of bearing hard@@ ships and enduring hard work .
in those seven days , in order to s@@ ave time , they ate d@@ ry cr@@ ust@@ y p@@ an@@ ca@@ kes and dr@@ ank pl@@ ain bo@@ iled water during the day and li@@ ved in the herdsmen &apos;s y@@ ur@@ ts at n@@ ight .
S@@ ome@@ times , they would especially r@@ ush to an area in order to give a propaganda lecture to only a few people .
apart from sp@@ aring no effort to carry out the propaganda activity from village to village , the propaganda team members also find time to help the local people tackle difficulties and problems in their production and livelihood and jo@@ ined them in fighting the floo@@ ds and providing dis@@ ast@@ er relief .
in order to carry out the state strategy of greatly developing the western regions , the Yili Autonomous Prefecture CPC Committee and the Yili Prefecture CPC Committee have decided to continually expand the propaganda scale ; en@@ rich the propaganda contents ; and train a propaganda contingent that will never leave the rural villages with an eye on ste@@ pping up grassroots organizations building .
Beijing , 28 Jan -- The Shuguang 2000-II SuperServer successfully developed by the State Intel@@ ligent Machinery Research and Development C@@ enter of the Chinese Academy of Science Com@@ pu@@ ter Institute passed in Beijing today the speci@@ al@@ ists &apos; appraisal conducted by the Ministry of Science and Technology .

Beijing , 4 Feb ( Xinhua ) -- The Chinese Government announced at the turn of the century that one of its economic priorities would be to speed up the development of its western parts .
Econom@@ ists here maintain that the strategy of developing western China was a timely one .
the strategy for large-scale development of western China , which President Jiang Zemin put forth early last year , and the national economic conference held late last year and the State Council conference held last January on developing the west all show that large-scale development of western China had become a common understanding of central and local leading hi@@ er@@ arch@@ ies across the country .
as early as in the eigh@@ ties , Deng Xiaoping , the chief arch@@ it@@ ec@@ t of China &apos;s reform and opening up program , already put forth the concept of coordin@@ ating the nation &apos;s economic development .
according to the concept , central and western China should first give consideration to the national interests by sup@@ porting the opening up and development of coastal areas in the east .
then , when the east has reached a certain stage of development , it should help central and western China speed up its development with even more resources in return .
moreover , ow@@ ing to the de@@ fl@@ ation trend , the state has adopted certain active f@@ isc@@ al policies to boost the economy , creating the situation where the government can af@@ for@@ d to support the development of the west with even more resources .
according to Zeng Pei@@ yuan , minister in charge of the State Development Planning Commission , this year the government will draw up ad@@ di@@ tional preferential policies for encour@@ aging foreign businesses to invest in western China and will sp@@ end more loans from international organizations on construction projects in the west .
this year , the state will continue to ti@@ l@@ t its investments toward western China , the next five-@@ year plan will include a special plan for the development of the west , and the government will invest a larger perc@@ ent@@ age of money incur@@ red from flo@@ ating national bon@@ ds in projects in western China .
Meanwhile , the People &apos;s Bank of China is also working on a credit policy to be carried out in western China , and the China Development Bank will soon set up many branches in western provinces and regions in an effort to give western China greater financial support in its development .
according to the experts , China &apos;s economic development in recent years has been hin@@ dered by in@@ adequate demand at home , and considerable portion of technology and labor are seeking new areas of production , new markets , and new areas of development .
on its part , the sp@@ ra@@ w@@ ling western China with rich natural resources offers en@@ ormous investment opportunities as well as market and development pot@@ enti@@ als .
the development of western China will provide vast areas for the nation &apos;s economic restructuring and industrial optim@@ ization and escal@@ ation .
China has basically add@@ ressed the problem of fe@@ eding the people@@ .I@@ ts food supp@@ ly is higher than demand@@ .This has created the r@@ are opportunity for the development of western China .
in the past , western China , in order to address its food problem , had to destroy its woodlands for subsist@@ ence , causing serious ra@@ vage to its environment .
the present food surplus can specifically serve the purpose of hel@@ ping western China rest@@ ore its woodlands , grass@@ lands , and the beauty of its land@@ sc@@ apes .
&#91; &quot; commentary &quot; by XNA reporter L@@ u Y@@ ongj@@ ian ( 77@@ 7@@ 3 3057 1696 ) : &quot; development of West China N@@ ee@@ ds a G@@ ood Plan in the F@@ ir@@ st Pl@@ ace &quot; &#93; &#91; FBIS Translated Text &#93; Beijing , 2 Feb ( X@@ I@@ N@@ H@@ U@@ A ) -- Af@@ ter the central authorities proposed that the development of West China should enter the concrete implementation stage this year , people from various social sectors , particularly the comrades in the western region , are extremely in@@ sp@@ i@@ red and eager to make a big go at it .
some localities have planned to increase investment , and others have begun returning land unfit for farm@@ ing to forestry and animal husbandry , raising the cur@@ tain on ecological con@@ struc@@ tion@@ .@@ B@@ ra@@ ving the pi@@ er@@ c@@ ingly cold wind , quite a few cadres from the western region went to the eastern and southern parts of the country , bus@@ ying themselves with the introduction of projects .
at the time when the heat wa@@ ve of developing West China gradually ran high , the recently established leading group for the development of the western region under the State Council held a meeting , at which it was pointed out that on the basis of thorough investig@@ ation and study , it is im@@ per@@ ative to draw up a realis@@ tic and feasible overall plan and some special plans now , and include them into the T@@ ent@@ h Fi@@ ve-@@ Year Plan for national economic and social development .
the reason why the central authorities have attached such great importance to the planning work for the western region development is that a good plan is the crux of making the first step toward the development of West China .
our fore@@ fa@@ thers said : Pre@@ p@@ aredness en@@ sures success , and un@@ prep@@ aredness sp@@ ell@@ s failure , which means that in doing everything , it is necessary to make thorough preparations and well-@@ conce@@ i@@ ved plans .
the large-scale development of the western region has a bearing on the overall situation of developing coordinated regional economy , promoting national unity , and maintaining social stability .
for instance , the land in West China accounts for more than one-@@ half of the country &apos;s total , where construction of infrastructure facilities should be reinforced , construction of water conservancy and comm@@ unication works is necessary , and construction projects of basic industries are indis@@ pen@@ s@@ able too .
in respect of science , education , and qualified personnel , it is necessary to strengthen comp@@ ul@@ s@@ ory and el@@ em@@ entary education , make a break@@ through in developing high-tech projects , import qualified personnel from other regions and , at the same time , train local talented personnel , bringing into full play the initiative of the existing talent .
in doing such heavy and complicated work , if we have not a good plan , it is hard to avoid running around in circles when the work is fully under way , and we may have to pay a consider@@ ably high pr@@ ice for the &quot; re@@ medi@@ es &quot; after problems c@@ ro@@ p up , which will inevitably imp@@ air the entire process of the development .
the central authorities stressed that in developing the western region , things must be done in accordance with the scientific law , as the formulation of scientific and meticulous plans is both demanded by the in@@ tr@@ in@@ si@@ c law governing the regional economic development , and has defin@@ ite objectives in view .
although there is no longer any phenomenon like the great leap forward which made r@@ ash advan@@ ces in all aspects regardless of objective conditions , yet in our economic sphere , inst@@ ances of re@@ d@@ undant construction and blin@@ dly put up establish@@ ments oc@@ cu@@ r from time to time , some of them are very serious .
making a scientific plan will help maintain un@@ fl@@ ag@@ ging enthusiasm and enhance the pr@@ ud@@ ent and rational spirit , so that good intentions will rea@@ p good results and the large-scale development of the western region will obtain great achievements .
it is precisely on the basis of summing up the experiences and lessons in the economic construction for years that the central authorities proposed that all the major construction projects of the western region development should be included in the plans for sufficient verification .
a scientific plan has both its guiding function and binding force .
without the guidance of a plan , there will probably emer@@ ge such a tendency that those who are in power or who hold higher positions have the final say .
with a plan , however , the prac@@ tices invol@@ ving a lot of paper work , considerations for sen@@ sib@@ ilities , and protection of local interests can be avoided .
in short , making a good plan at the beginning of the construction is the crucial measure for reducing hap@@ ha@@ z@@ ard economic development .
to be authoritative , a plan must be scientific and conform to the objective reality .
whether a plan is scientific or not involves many things , the most important of which is the back@@ war@@ dness of the western region in economic and social development@@ .It was formed in history for a long period of time and needs a long process to change this situ@@ ation@@ .Th@@ at is why we should make the best use of our time to take action for the western development while making full mental preparations for a long-term and arduous struggle .
in making plans , therefore , we should base ourselves on the present and have our eyes on the future , and combine the solution of the current outstanding problems with the realiz@@ ation of the long-term development objecti@@ v@@ es.@@ O@@ ur plans should both reflec@@ t the spirit of em@@ an@@ ci@@ pating the mind and positively for@@ ging ahead , and conform to the principle of seeking truth from facts and following the objective law@@ s.In particular , adequate considerations should be given to the natural and ge@@ o@@ grap@@ h@@ ical conditions and the actual circumstances of various localities .
to draw up an authoritative plan , we must also pay attention to coordination and comprehensive equ@@ il@@ ib@@ ri@@ um .
for the western region development , various sectors , trades , and departments of the national economy are oblig@@ ated to make plans .
in terms of ecological construction alone , the departments of forestry , water conservancy , agric@@ ulture , and land should particip@@ ate in de@@ vis@@ ing plan@@ s.@@ Various departments must work in cooperation with division of labor , and the plans must be well lin@@ ked and coordinated to avoid dis@@ harm@@ ony .
as a do@@ z@@ en provinces , municipalities , and autonomous regions as well as the Xinjiang Pro@@ duc@@ tion and Construction Cor@@ ps are involved in the western development , various localities , especially the neighb@@ oring provinces , municipalities , and autonomous regions , must coordinate with one another in dr@@ af@@ ting plans .
if they only proceed from the interests of their own provinces , areas , or units regardless of the overall situation of the western development , they are unable to play a harm@@ on@@ ious and res@@ on@@ ant symp@@ hon@@ y for the development of West China .
it has been learned that the State Development Planning Commission and the State Forestry Bureau have jo@@ int@@ ly drawn up a preliminary plan on the construction of infrastructure facilities and the change of grain plots to other uses for ecological consideration , the experimental work for which will be carried out in selected spots this year .
there is a relation@@ ship of mutual pro@@ motion between experiments and plans , and between the selected spots and the entire areas , and the experience gained in the selected spots can serve the purpose of perfec@@ ting the plans and help carry out the work in a comprehensive way .
judging from the current situation , various localities showed great initiative in making ecological experiments , the great majority of the provinces , municipalities , and autonomous regions wanted to expand their scope of experiments , and some of them even proposed that their experiments would cover the entire province .
while fully affir@@ ming this enthusiasm , we should also pay attention to avoi@@ ding over@@ -@@ enthusiastic and blin@@ d acti@@ on@@ s.I@@ f the experimental scope is too large at the beginning , then the mean@@ ing of making experiments in selected points no longer exist@@ s .
what we need to emphasize is that in making plans or experiments , or even in carrying out the future comprehensive development , two things must be respected : 1 ) The market law must be respected .
under the conditions of developing the socialist market economy , we cannot pu@@ rely rely on the support from the state and ob@@ stin@@ ately ask the state for projects and funds for developing the western region@@ .@@ In@@ ste@@ ad , we must organ@@ ically combine the state &apos;s m@@ ac@@ ro@@ economic regulation and control with the market mechanism and fully exerc@@ ise the role of the market in the allocation of resources .
2 ) The masses &apos; wishes must be respected , and their initiative and cre@@ ati@@ veness must be brought into full play .
the practice for many years has shown that even if we do things with good intentions , we must also fully respect the masses &apos; wishes , and only by ar@@ ous@@ ing the masses &apos; enthusiasm to work with one heart can we initi@@ ate an excellent situation for the western development .
it is grati@@ fying that , in the western region now , the masses &apos; enthusiasm for opening up cultiv@@ ated land on sl@@ op@@ es and returning land unfit for grain production to forestry and animal husbandry is running high@@ .This valuable enthusiasm of the peasants must be seriously protec@@ ted through such measures as reducing peasants &apos; burdens , and others .
news that has recently spread here indic@@ ates that some localities in the western region have introduced or are studying the introduction of preferential policies , hoping to import funds from the eastern region and foreign countries through various methods .
of course , this is extremely necessary , but we must note that making a good plan is equ@@ ally very important .
if we have a scientific and meticulous plan and disseminate it extensively so that the entire world will clearly know about what and how we are going to do for the development of West China , then people will remove their wor@@ r@@ ies as they have seen our determination , sincerity , metho@@ dic@@ al@@ ness , and measures in the development .
once their doub@@ ts and mis@@ gi@@ v@@ ings are cle@@ ared , they will vi@@ e with one another to make bold investment in the western region .
therefore , making a good plan is conducive to creating a fully appe@@ aling investment environment .
we believe that with the wise leadership of the party &apos;s central committee and the valuable experiences gained in reform , opening up , and economic construction , the scientific planning work for the western development will certainly y@@ i@@ el@@ d good results , and the magnificent ide@@ al of the large-scale development of West China will certainly become a real@@ it@@ y.@@ CPP@@ 200@@ 00@@ 20@@ 4@@ 00@@ 00@@ 18 &#91; Des@@ cri@@ p@@ tion of source : Beijing Xinhua D@@ om@@ estic Ser@@ vice in Chinese -- China &apos;s official news service ( New China N@@ e@@ ws A@@ gency ) &#93; ( end@@ all ) 0@@ 20@@ 9@@ 23 yc@@ c /
upon he@@ aring a report on issues related to harnessing the Yellow River &#91; Huang He &#93; and other water conservancy projects , State Council Vice Premier Wen Jiabao emphasized that water issues are important factors restricting our nation &apos;s economic and social development.@@ Water conservancy projects are very complex , system@@ ic construction projects , requiring complete planning , comprehensive management , an emphasis on important points , guaranteed quality , and un@@ ce@@ asing per@@ sist@@ ence in the work of flood prevention and drought resistance .
on February 2 , Wen Jiabao came to the Ministry of Water Resources to hear a report by the head of the Ministry of Water Resources , Wang Shucheng , regarding water conservancy projects since last year , and a report by E Jing@@ ping , director of the Yellow River Water Conservancy Committee under the Ministry of Water Resources , regarding major issues and policies concerning harnessing the Yellow River .
Wen Jiabao fully affirmed that in 1999 our nation made remarkable achievements in water conservancy construction , and hoped that the cadres and staff on the battle lines of water conservancy would continue their efforts , complete this year &apos;s missions , and achieve even greater accomplish@@ ments .
he made the following requests with regard to several important issues in water conservancy : first , complete planning .
scientific , complete water conservancy construction plans must be drawn up in accordance with the demands of the overall mission and overall goals of national economic and social development , and must be in line with overall planning for national economic and social development .
D@@ ra@@ wing up plans must be treated as an important and pressing mission ; and , as a task fundamental to the strengthening of water conservancy construction , it must be diligently carried out in a contro@@ l@@ led manner .
the Ministry of Water Resources must draw up a comprehensive national plan for water conservancy construction development to be used in guiding the work of water conservancy nationwide .
flood prevention and development plans must also be drawn up for the major river bas@@ ins .
water conservancy projects within a river basin must all be carried out under the guidance of the overall plan and the plan for the river basin .
second , comprehensive management .
serious flooding , the s@@ car@@ city of water resources , ero@@ sion , and wor@@ s@@ ening water pollution are currently the most important issues , and comprehensive management must be carried out .
flood prevention is the primary mission , and it is also work that must be done frequently and diligently .
flood prevention must be integrated with water conserv@@ ation , ecological protection , and pollution prevention and control .
in addition , non-@@ engineering measures such as meteor@@ o@@ logy , hydro@@ logy , monitoring , communications , information systems , and the like must be strengthened .
water conservancy projects must establish management while placing emphasis on the right things , which means that while project quality must be taken seriously , maintenance and up@@ keep must also be strengthened .
third , emphasize important points .
proper handling requi@@ res making the relation@@ ships among what is possible , the current situation and the long-term .
according to the unified plan , major issues relating to the national economy and people &apos;s livelihood and urgent problems are resolved first , and moreover are integrated with the fulfillment of long-range planning goals .
according to the request made by General Secretary Jiang Zemin , we must insist on taking time to reach decisions , comprehensive consideration , scientific selec@@ tions and comparisons , and meticulous designs for major water conservancy projects .
the establishment and design of projects must be fully deb@@ ated and repe@@ ated comparisons must be made in order to make the project stand the test of time .
Fourth , ensure project quality .
this is critical to strengthening water conservancy construction management .
in the recent period of time , in accordance with requests from the central government and relevant national regulations , the Ministry of Water Resources has taken a series of measures to strengthen project quality management , and has achieved remarkable success .
however , many problems still re@@ main in water conservancy projects .
the key to solving these problems lies in emphasizing the word strict , as in strict demands , strict management , and strict execution of the system of rules and regul@@ ation@@ s.@@ No@@ t one lin@@ k can be left out in ensuring the quality of water conservancy projects .
Wen Jiabao stressed that flood prevention and drought resistance rel@@ ate to the lives , property , and security of the people , and must be given high regard at all times .
first , we must get a handle on flood prevention construction and raise the flood-prevention capability of major rivers by emphasizing embank@@ ment construction now , and gradually bringing the embank@@ ments along the major rivers up to flood prevention standards , in accordance with the overall demands of flood prevention plans .
second , we must implement a flood-prevention responsibility system , strengthen pre@@ -@@ flood inspec@@ tions , and implement flood prevention measures .
this has been a cold winter , and we must put particular emphasis on the work of prev@@ ent@@ ing flooding due to m@@ el@@ ting ice on nor@@ thern rivers .
establish modern@@ ized meteor@@ ological , hydro@@ logical , and communications facilities , strengthen analysis and research of r@@ ain@@ f@@ all and water conditions , and improve the accur@@ acy of fo@@ rec@@ ast@@ ing .
Wen Jiabao also came to the headquarters of the National F@@ lood Prevention and D@@ rought Re@@ sistance Office , where he paid a visit to the cadres and staff at the Prevention Office .
Beijing , 3 Feb ( ZTS ) -- The State Council recently approved the establishment of a leadership group for the development of west China , to take overall charge of this development work@@ .@@ Zhu Rongji has been appointed head of the group , with Wen Jiabao as deputy head@@ .The members include 17 minister@@ ial@@ -level officials .
the group members include : Zeng Peiyan , director of the State Development and Planning Commission ; S@@ heng Hu@@ aren , director of the State Economic and Trade Commission ; E@@ duc@@ ation Minister Chen Zh@@ ili ; Science and Technology Minister Zhu L@@ il@@ an ; Liu Ji@@ b@@ in , director of the National Defense Science , Technology , and Industry Commission ; Li De@@ zh@@ u , director of the State N@@ ation@@ alities Affairs Commission ; F@@ in@@ ance Minister X@@ iang Hu@@ a@@ ic@@ heng ; Tian F@@ eng@@ shan , secretary of the party group of the Ministry of L@@ and Resources ; R@@ ail@@ roads Minister Fu Zhihuan ; Comm@@ unications Minister Huang Zhendong ; Information Industry Minister Wu J@@ ichuan ; Water Conservancy Minister Wang Shucheng ; A@@ gr@@ ic@@ ulture Minister Chen Y@@ a@@ ob@@ ang ; Culture Minister Sun Jiazheng ; People &apos;s Bank of China President D@@ ai Xi@@ ang@@ long ; Liu Yun@@ shan , deputy director of the Central Pro@@ p@@ aganda Department in charge of rout@@ ine affairs ; Tian Z@@ ong@@ ming , director of the State B@@ roadca@@ sting , C@@ in@@ em@@ a , and Television Administration ; State Forestry Bureau Director Wang Z@@ hib@@ ao ; and State Foreign Experts Bureau Director Wan Xu@@ e@@ yuan .
the State Council Leadership Group for West China Development has an office subordin@@ ate to it ; a specific organ has been set up in the State Development and Planning Commission , to undertake the day to day work of the leadership group .
Zeng Peiyan is director and Wang Chun@@ z@@ heng and D@@ uan Ying@@ bi are the deputy directors of this office .
the main duties of this office under the leadership group are : to look into and put forward proposals regarding the strategy , development plans , major issues , and relevant policies and rules and regulations for west China development , and promote sustained , rapid , and healthy economic development there ; to look into and put forward proposals regarding rural economic development , key infrastructure construction , protection and building of the ecological environment , restructuring , resource exploitation , and the arrangement of major projects , and to organize and coordinate the enac@@ t@@ ment and implementation of plans for returning farm@@ land to fo@@ rest ( grassland ) ; to look into and put forward policy proposals regarding deep@@ ening reforms in west China , expanding opening up to the world , bringing in domestic foreign investment , technology , and talent , and to coordinate the all-round development of the economy and of science , education , and culture ; and to undertake other tasks of the leadership group .
China formally proposed implementing the strategy of major development of west China at the national economic work conference last year .
having been discussed until early this year , this major development strategy is gradually he@@ ating up.@@ C@@ l@@ ues to the thinking on western development are also being gradually revealed .
from 19 to 22 January the State Council Leadership Group for West China Development held a conference in Beijing on western development , at which Premier Zhu Rongji set out the scheme for this development , so that the work can get comprehensively started as soon as possible .
since last August Premier Zhu Rongji has taken leading members of the State Council on many visits to the western provinces and autonomous regions to prepar@@ e the plans for western development ; he has also put forward specific guidel@@ ines and policies for this work .
Beijing , 31 Jan ( Xinhua ) -- The All-China Federation of Trade Unions , the Communist Youth League &#91; CYL &#93; Central Committee , and the All-China Women &apos;s Federation held a joint forum in Beijing on the morning of 31 January to mark the fifth anniversary of the publication of President Jiang Zemin &apos;s speech entitled &quot; Continue To Strive To Promote the Accomplishment of the Great Cause of the Reunification of the Motherland . &quot;
as has been proven in practice over the past five years , President Jiang Zemin &apos;s important speech has a very important guiding significance in developing cross-strait relations and promoting the peaceful reunification of the motherland in the current stage .
Zhang Junjiu , vice chairman of the Executive Committee of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions , said : breakthroughs have been made in the exchanges and contacts between the trade unions and labor circles on both sides of the strait over the past five years , and exchanges between the industrial trade unions on both sides and between the trade unions of Taiwan Island and the provinces and municipalities of the mainland have been promoted .
during the exchanges and mutual visits , people of the same trades from the trade unions of both sides expressed their feelings of hope for reunification and opposition to separation .
to our regret , however , Lee Teng-hui &#91; Li Denghui &#93; openly trotted out the &quot; two-state theory &quot; when cross-strait relations were developing continuously , thus seriously undermin@@ ing the foundation for the normal development of cross-strait relations and greatly damaging the interests of Taiwan compatriots .
Millions of staff and workers and trade unions at all levels throughout the country resolutely op@@ pose this criminal act to split the motherland .
Zhang Junjiu said : settling the Taiwan issue and achieving the complete reunification of the motherland is where the fundamental interests of the Chinese nation li@@ e and is an irresistible historical tren@@ d@@ .It is hoped that the Taiwan authorities will clearly understand the situation and , proce@@ eding from the fundamental interests of the Chinese nation , will comp@@ ly with the trend of this era and the aspiration of the Taiwan people to seek peace , stability , and development , and promote the continuous development of cross-strait relations with concrete deeds .
after rest@@ oring sovereignty over Hong Kong , the Chinese Government once again successfully rest@@ ored sovereignty over Macao in the just@@ -@@ passed 1999 in line with the principle of &quot; one country , two systems &quot; put forward by Comrade Deng Xiaoping , thus erec@@ ting another new mil@@ est@@ one in the process of accomplishing the great cause of the reunification of the motherland .
the successful practice of the principle of &quot; one country , two systems &quot; in the Hong Kong and Macao Special Administrative Regi@@ ons has won hear@@ t@@ felt support from the large numbers of Hong Kong and Macao compatriots .
the principle of &quot; one country , two systems &quot; has been understood and accepted by more and more people .
today when we have entered the new century , settling the Taiwan issue and ul@@ tim@@ ately accomplishing the sacred mission of the reunification of the motherland have emerged prominently in front of all Chinese people , including Taiwan compatriots .
the All-China Women &apos;s Federation will continue to expand the exchanges and contacts with Taiwan women and play its due role in achieving peaceful reunification of the two sides of the strait at an early date and op@@ pos@@ ing the splittist forces in Taiwan .
Bayinqolu , executive secretary of the Sec@@ ret@@ ar@@ i@@ at of the CYL Central Committee and chairman of the All-China Youth Federation , said : youths are future masters of the two sides of the str@@ a@@ it.@@ Promoting the development of cross-strait relations and achieving the complete reunification of the motherland constitute a sacred responsibility for the youths on both sides of the strait .
history has proven and will continue to prove that only with the reunification of the motherland can the nation be revit@@ alized comprehensively , and only with national unity can a more br@@ il@@ li@@ ant tom@@ or@@ row be created .
Bayinqolu said that in the new century , youths on both sides of the strait should cooper@@ ate and work hard together to attain the magnificent go@@ al of the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation .
at the moment when we say g@@ ood@@ b@@ y@@ e to the old year and usher in the new year , the All-China Federation of Trade Unions , the CYL Central Committee , and the All-China Women &apos;s Federation extended Spring Festival greetings to the large numbers of lab@@ ore@@ rs , youths , and women in Taiwan .
Fu@@ zhou , 31 Jan ( ZXS ) -- On the fifth anniversary of President Jiang Zemin &apos;s speech entitled &quot; Continue to Strive to Promote the Great Cause of the Motherland &apos;s reunification , &quot; Chen Zhengtong , vice chairman of the Fu@@ j@@ ian provincial committee of the Taiwan Democratic Self-@@ government Al@@ liance &#91; TDSA &#93; , said in an inter@@ view that the sons and daughters of China all over the world were greatly encour@@ aged by President Jiang &apos;s eight-point proposal , and the members of the TDSA and other Taiwan compatriots living in the mainland felt extremely happy ; all of them hoped that the Taiwan authorities would adapt to the tide of history and make a positive response as prac@@ tical action for fur@@ thering the development of cross-strait ties and promoting the process of the motherland &apos;s reunification .
what they regret , however , is that cross-strait ties have developed in tor@@ tu@@ ous fashion over the past five years .
on the one hand , imp@@ el@@ led by the basic guideline of &quot; peaceful reunification , one country , two systems &quot; and the various policies of the motherland &apos;s government , and with the support of the Taiwan compatriots living on the island , there has been great development in exchanges and cooperation and in the &quot; three links &quot; ; Taiwan compatriots have already invested a certain amount in the mainland , and the process of peaceful reunification of the motherland has been effectively promoted ; on the other hand , the good development of cross-strait ties has been seriously ha@@ m@@ pered due to vigorous interference by separatist elements in Taiwan and foreign anti-China forces .
Chen Zhengtong said that taking a general look at the situation on Taiwan in recent years , the separatist forces have caused a tem@@ por@@ ary clam@@ or , and separatist activities have become more and more inten@@ se ; they do not stop at shou@@ ting about &quot; joining the United Nations &quot; and &quot; opening up a space for international existence , &quot; but have ste@@ pped up their activities to wea@@ ken the Taiwan compatriots &apos; awareness of the Chinese nation .
in particular , on 9 July last year Li Teng-hui openly dished up the &quot; two-state theory &quot; ; his actions have nat@@ ur@@ ally been greeted with strong indi@@ g@@ nation and con@@ cer@@ ted condemnation by all patriotic compatriots at home and abroad ; nor have they gained international response and support .
following the reversion of Hong Kong and Taiwan to the motherland , the issue of settling the Taiwan problem is conspicu@@ ously facing the entire Chinese people .
Chen Zhengtong said that the Taiwan people have a glorious patriotic tradition ; their aspir@@ ations to keep their way of life un@@ chang@@ ed and to be masters in their own house are fully understood and respected by the CPC and the Chinese People &apos;s Government .
he believes that Taiwan &apos;s future lies in the motherland &apos;s reunification , and the per@@ ver@@ se behavior of &quot; Taiwan independence &quot; elements can only cause tension in the strait and also threatens peace and security in the Asia-Pacific region ; the Taiwan compatriots and peace-loving people the world over do not want to see this .
this is because there is only one China , and Taiwan is part of Chinese territory ; this is und@@ en@@ iable fact , and no force can change in any way Taiwan &apos;s status as a part of Chinese territory .
as a Taiwan compat@@ riot , he expressed resolute support for President Jiang Zemin &apos;s eight-point proposal on Taiwan .
he greatly ap@@ preci@@ ated President Jiang Zemin &apos;s remarks in the proposals on &quot; strive to achieve peaceful reunification , Chinese should not fight Chinese . &quot;
he believes that the Taiwan problem is a matter left over from the Chinese civil war , but no Chinese wants another b@@ loo@@ dy war like that , and the Taiwan compatriots on the mainland and their relatives in Taiwan do not want it either .
the Taiwan people can only achieve happiness through reunification ; and only through reunification can the Taiwan compatriots , together with the people of all nationalities in China , truly share in the international dignity and honor of the great motherland .
people on both sides of the strait enter@@ tain ar@@ d@@ ent hopes .
he expressed belief that so long as people act in accordance with the demands of President Jiang Zemin &apos;s eight-point proposal , w@@ age ce@@ as@@ el@@ ess struggle against separatist elements inside and outside Taiwan , and actively promote the development of cross-strait ties , the motherland &apos;s complete reunification and the all-round rejuvenation of the Chinese nation can certainly be achieved .
this was to p@@ ave the way for the United States to provide advanced weapons to Taiwan , and include Taiwan in the T@@ MD &#91; The@@ ater Missile Defense &#93; The commentary said that the United States ignored the consequences and incorporated the security of other countr@@ ys under its own law .
this is n@@ a@@ ked heg@@ im@@ onism and power politics , and an obvious violation against the three Sino-US communi@@ ques@@ .The attempts of anti-China politicians to obstruct China &apos;s great cause of reunification by wantonly interf@@ ering in China &apos;s internal affairs and b@@ ac@@ king up the splittist forces of &quot; Taiwan independence &quot; is clearly disc@@ lo@@ sed .
the commentary held that if the &quot; Taiwan Security Enhancement Act &quot; bill is enacted into law , not only will Sino-US relations be de@@ v@@ ast@@ atingly damaged , but also the arrog@@ ance of the Taiwan splittist forces will be in@@ fl@@ ate@@ d@@ .The tension in the Taiwan Strait will be intensified and the peace and stability of the Asi@@ an-@@ Pacific region gravely threat@@ ened .
the commentary ur@@ ged the US Government to keep their pro@@ mis@@ es of not le@@ tting the bill be enacted into law , which would bring endless tr@@ oub@@ les .
Beijing , 3 Feb ( ZXS ) -- The lat@@ est edition of Zh@@ on@@ ghu@@ a Ying@@ ca@@ i , a bimonthly , has published the Chinese New Year messages of ten Chinese ministers , including Tang Jiaxuan , minister of foreign affairs ; Zeng Peiyan , minister in charge of the State Development and Planning Commission ; Gao Changli , minister of justice ; and Sun Jiazheng , minister of culture .
Tang Jiaxuan says China will take an active part in multilateral diplomatic activities of international organizations , firmly safeguard the objectives and principles in the UN Charter and univers@@ all@@ y-@@ acknowledged norms governing international relations , and work hard with all peace-loving countries and peoples in the world in p@@ ushing for the construction of a just and rational international political and economic new order so as to play our part in building a peaceful , safe , prosperous , and stable new world .
Zeng Peiyan says : looking ahead , China will , by the m@@ iddle of the next century , have attained its thir@@ d-@@ step strategic objective and become an af@@ flu@@ ent , powerful , democratic , and civil socialist modern country and the Chinese nation will have achieved its great revit@@ alization !
it will come up with grand projects and accomplish them , and it will act as a good advis@@ or and assistant to the CPC Central Committee and the State Council .
its current priorities include studying how to expand internal demand and speed up restructuring ; studying key issues concerning medium@@ - and long-range development on the basis of the plan of the 15th National Party Congress ; studying the strategic issue of developing Western China in a big way ; and studying the new situations China confron@@ ts while opening up to the outside and coming up with countermeasures .
Gao Changli says in his message : J@@ ud@@ icial bodies have special responsibilities to be@@ ar while undertaking the great task of managing the country by law .
while doing our j@@ ob@@ s , we must continue to heigh@@ ten the nation &apos;s concept of the legal system and the law and accomplish all other relevant projec@@ ts.@@ We must do a good job in managing our prisons , educ@@ ating in@@ m@@ ates through labor , and ensuring the safety of our prisons so that our performance in reform@@ ing con@@ vic@@ ts and law@@ -@@ break@@ ers will continue to be among the best in the world.@@ We will continue to reform and develop our legal services for grass@@ -@@ roots units , including law@@ y@@ er and not@@ ar@@ ization services .
Sun Jiazheng says : in 2000 , China &apos;s cultural exchanges with foreign countries will continue to expand , and we will continue to up@@ grade our cultural exchange programs and improve their quality .
we will make ear@@ n@@ est efforts to organize the many large cultural exchange programs , such as the &quot; Great Ge@@ t-@@ To@@ gether of the Century , &quot; the Second Shanghai International Art Festival , and the S@@ i@@ xth China Art Festival .
other ministers who have had their New Year messages published in the bimonthly are Zhang W@@ ei@@ q@@ ing , minister in charge of the State Family Planning Commission ; Li Jin@@ hua , aud@@ itor general of the Auditing Administration ; Wang Shucheng , minister of water resources ; Fu Zhihuan , minister of ra@@ il@@ ways ; Huang Zhendong , minister of communications ; and D@@ o@@ j@@ e C@@ ering , minister of civil affairs . ,
however , reality warns us that we must not rela@@ x our effort to crack down on smuggling in the slightest and must keep up the high pressure and strictly guard against a res@@ urg@@ ence of smuggl@@ ing@@ .A@@ s top@@ -echelon Chinese leaders put it , &quot; there is no such thing as final victory in the battle against smuggling . &quot;
last year , China crac@@ ked over 21@@ ,000 cases of smuggling and tr@@ af@@ fic@@ king in smuggled goods , worth 1@@ 2.@@ 7 billion yuan .
the public and the business community have truly felt that the government is cracking down on smuggling with un@@ preced@@ ented determination and for@@ c@@ ef@@ ul@@ ness .
there are four main reas@@ ons why the antismuggling campaign has produced marked results since the national work conference on cracking down on smuggling in the second half of 199@@ 8@@ .@@ -- T@@ op@@ -echelon Chinese leaders have attached great importance to this campaign and have made plans for antismuggling operations from a political per@@ spec@@ ti@@ ve.@@ Zhu Rongji , L@@ u@@ o G@@ an , Wu Y@@ i , and others have inspec@@ ted antismuggling work on many occa@@ sions and the central authorities have directly instruc@@ ted the handling of a b@@ atch of big and important cases , including the one in Zh@@ an@@ jiang .
-- The Army , the police force , poli@@ tic@@ al@@ -@@ jud@@ icial organs , and party and government organs have stopped their invol@@ ve@@ ment in business and in the running of enterprises , de@@ pri@@ ving some smugglers of their protection and sh@@ el@@ ter ; the effort against corruption has been intensified , ec@@ ho@@ ing the antismuggling campaign .
the General Administration of C@@ u@@ stom@@ s alone has investigated and handled 13 officials at the level of provincial department head or equivalent and 50 officials at the level of provincial sec@@ tion head or equivalent who have viol@@ ated discipline and law .
-- M@@ eas@@ ures for comprehensive improvement have been implemented and powerful joint forces have developed in the antismuggling campaign .
over 6@@ ,000 enterprises that conducted import and export business in violation of laws and regulations have been pen@@ alized and the net@@ working of computers among relevant departments has pl@@ ugg@@ ed the lo@@ op@@ hol@@ es that smugglers would otherwise have taken advantage of .
-- The law enforcement departments have continually conducted large-scale specialized antismuggling operations by foc@@ using on key areas , key channels , and key commodities and kept up the high pressure on smuggling .
in their analysis of the trends and characteristics of smuggling , customs officials pointed out : at present , smuggling through the import and export channels by dec@@ ei@@ ving customs and &quot; working around customs chec@@ ks &quot; remains serious ; smuggling of cigarettes and finished oil products in the Bei@@ b@@ u Wan waters remains rather serious , as smugglers are tr@@ ying to move into China some of the g@@ as@@ ol@@ ine that has been stoc@@ k@@ p@@ iled on Vietnam &apos;s Yong@@ sh@@ i &#91; 3057 13@@ 95 &#93; Island for a year ; smuggling in finished oil products at the est@@ uary of Zhu Jiang and in the waters in its vic@@ in@@ ity has recently become more active again ; smuggling in sensitive commodities in b@@ ul@@ k along the sou@@ the@@ ast coast occur@@ s from time to time and smuggling by the masses in a few isol@@ ated coastal areas still goes on ; smugglers are still mo@@ stly legal persons and wh@@ ol@@ ly and par@@ tially foreign-@@ funded enterprises have gone to the top of the list as main smugglers ; industrial chem@@ ic@@ als , ra@@ w texti@@ le materials , finished oil products , e@@ dible oil , autom@@ ob@@ il@@ es , motor@@ c@@ y@@ cles , cigarettes , and so on still feat@@ ure larg@@ ely among smuggled commodities .
as the smugglers it@@ ch for action , the antismuggling forces must not allow themselves &quot; a brea@@ thing sp@@ ell . &quot;
the key commodities that the crackdown will be directed to are still the ab@@ ov@@ e-m@@ enti@@ oned &quot; two types of materials , &quot; &quot; two types of oil , &quot; &quot; two types of motor@@ ized vehicles , &quot; cigarettes , electronic products , paper , mechanical and electrical plan@@ ts , and so on .
it is necessary to strengthen the exchange of administrative assistance with the Hong Kong and Macao customs authorities ; conduct specialized joint operations against smuggling at appropriate times ; rein@@ force and improve the &quot; national import and export customs dec@@ l@@ aration verification system &quot; and accelerate the construction of the &quot; port electronic law enforcement system ; &quot; implement the system where@@ by the departments in charge of specific industries are responsible for antismuggling results ; continue to clean up and rec@@ tify the ports in the second c@@ ate@@ g@@ ory and strengthen control of small transport ships that go to and from Hong Kong and Macao .
the responsible persons at customs emphasized that it is necessary to ad@@ minister customs strictly and resolutely pur@@ ge each and every &quot; b@@ ore@@ r &quot; discovered with no len@@ iency wh@@ at@@ so@@ ever .
an effort should be made to significantly strengthen the leadership groups at various levels in the customs sector , significantly raise the quality of the cadre contingent , marke@@ dly improve their conduct and discipline , and effectively chec@@ k the phenomen@@ a of corruption in law enforcement within the next two years .
on the eve of the Spring Festival of 2000 , Jiang Zemin , general secretary of the CPC Central Committee , president of China , and chairman of the Central Military Commission , wrote a sp@@ ring festival greeting message , via the Spring Festival S@@ oi@@ ree b@@ road@@ c@@ ast by the Central Television Station , to ext@@ end Spring Festival greetings to people of all nationalities throughout the country , Chinese living abroad , and overseas Chinese .
his message read@@ s : on the occasion of the joy@@ ous Spring Festival , I wish the motherland to be prosperous , weal@@ thy , and strong , and the people happy and healthy .
&#91; FBIS Translated Text &#93; Beijing , 31 Jan ( Xinhua ) -- The Fourth Plenary S@@ ession of the 15th CPC Central Committee and the central economic work conference , which was held soon after the plenary s@@ ession , proposed that the state set about implementing the strategy for the massive development of the western region .
the development of the western region will meet tremendous obstacles if the problem of the resources of human tal@@ ents is not solved .
now a task of top priority is to quickly build a mighty contingent of qualified personnel of various types who can meet the strategic needs of the massive development of the western region as well as a contingent of high-quality cadres .
to build a mighty contingent of qualified personnel of various types , it is necessary , above all , for the central authorities to make overall planning , to coordinate efforts to solve problems , and to r@@ ationally ad@@ just the distribution and structure of qualified personnel , including the regional structure of quality personnel .
in recent years , the Organization Department of the CPC Central Committee , the Ministry of Science and Technology , the State E@@ thnic Affairs Commission , and other central organs , as well as relevant government departments , have formulated a series of preferential policies and measures concerning the transf@@ er of qualified personnel to the western region and the training of minority nationality cadres .
in coordination with relevant departments , the Organization Department of the CPC Central Committee is studying and making strategic planning for qualified personnel for the massive development of the western region , strengthening the backbone of the party and government leadership , and assigning high-@@ standard professional personnel to the region through various channels .
party organizations at various levels in the western region should seize the day , seize the h@@ our ; with a sense of historic ur@@ gency and responsibility , they should speed up the selection , training , or education of qualified personnel .
centering on the strategic objectives of the massive development of the western region , they should accelerate the reform of the personnel system relating to cadres and strive to create an emplo@@ y@@ ment environment in which talent will find its way to distinction , and human resources will be turned to the best account ; they should arouse the initiative of qualified personnel to the maximum .
now it is particularly necessary to further adopt new ideas , to widen the field of vision , to select local young qualified personnel with a potential for development and a prospec@@ t for training , and to strengthen leading bodies at various levels by assigning them to such bodies in order to fully ta@@ p the local potential in human resources .
in selecting and ap@@ pointing cadres , we should completely do away with the old concept of giving priority only to seni@@ ority or demand@@ ing perfec@@ tion in the selection of cadres and conscientiously enforce the &quot; Interi@@ m Regulations on the S@@ election and Ap@@ pointment of Le@@ ading Party and Government C@@ ad@@ res ; &quot; in the ap@@ pointment of personnel , we should give greater scope to democr@@ acy , adhere to the principles of open@@ ness , justice , competition , and being selec@@ tive , and ensure that those with ability and political integrity who have made remarkable achievements and who are acknowledged as outstanding cadres by the masses are selected for leading bodies at various levels ; by having cadres work at higher and lower levels and through the exchange of cadres and the ro@@ tation of work posts , we should place them at appropriate posts ; we should promote the rational allocation of human resources and make the best use of qualified personnel .
by carrying out those measures , we should vigorously improve the age , educ@@ ational , and professional structures of leading bodies at various levels in order to increase their vitality .
while continu@@ ing to do a good job in selecting and sending cadres to Xinjiang and Ti@@ be@@ t , we should step up our efforts to train young cadres of various types to meet the needs of the development of the western region .
we should effectively strengthen the building of the contingent of minority nationality cadres in order to adapt ourselves to the new situation .
we should make feasible plans for the training of qualified personnel and increase the investment in the development of science , technology , culture , and education ; we should effectively implement a training responsibility system and adopt a measure for comb@@ ining &quot; sending one out and then asking him in &quot; with &quot; sending one to work at a lower level with his original position retained for him at a higher level ; &quot; we should select young cadres for systematic training or education at party and cadres schools at various levels or at col@@ leg@@ es and uni@@ ver@@ si@@ ties in a planned way , by stages , and in groups .
experts and sch@@ ol@@ ars from institutions of higher learning and man@@ ag@@ er@@ ial personnel from economically developed areas should be invited to conduct scientific and technological training classes or give lectures to im@@ part knowledge of advanced science and technology and of modern management to cadres .
we should select in a planned way a number of outstanding young cadres for temper@@ ing themselves at central state organs or in economically developed areas with their original positions retained for them , in order to help them widen their field of vision , adopt new ideas , and increase their abilities .
to meet the socialist market economy &apos;s requirements for the allocation of qualified personnel , party organizations at various levels in the western region should quickly develop a standard personnel market .
in the past , as a result of rapid economic development and preferential policy on personnel in the eastern region , some qualified personnel in the western region went there to work .
now the western region should firmly seize the good opportunity for massive development , formulate a preferential policy , improve working conditions , and step up its efforts to bring in and use qualified personnel ; not only should it fully develop and uti@@ lize its own human resources but it should be able to retain qualified personnel and use them cre@@ atively ; moreover , it should make positive efforts to attr@@ act a large number of qualified personnel from developed areas and even from abroad to work for the massive development of the western region .
with the step-by-step implementation of the strategy for the massive development of the western region , it is necessary to effectively strengthen the education and management of cadres and to step up the improvement of the party &apos;s work style and the building of a clean and honest administration .
party organizations at various levels must proceed from their concern and care for the cadres , make ha@@ y while the sun sh@@ ines , strictly enforce various rules and regulations , strengthen the supervision and management of human , financial , and material resources , and prevent any problems of corruption among the cadres .
they should conscientiously implement democratic centr@@ al@@ ism ; major m@@ att@@ ers concerning the selection of projects , public bidding , and spending of a large amount of money must be discussed and decided collec@@ tively , which must not determined by a few personnel , so as to prevent the phenomenon of striking deals between power and mon@@ ey@@ .It is necessary to establish and improve a financial management system and use special funds for special pur@@ pos@@ es only ; to establish and improve a democratic supervision system , make government and financial affairs known to the public , and increase the transp@@ aren@@ cy of funds management ; and to establish and improve an economic auditing system and urg@@ e cadres to accurately use their power and to be clean and honest through the auditing of leading cadres &apos; economic responsibility during their terms of office and at their depar@@ ture from their posts .
efforts should be made to resolutely eliminate the corrup@@ t phenomenon of spending public funds for w@@ ining , d@@ ining , and pleas@@ u@@ re@@ -@@ seeking and to crack down on economic crimes of embezzling state development funds according to law , such as mis@@ appropri@@ ating public funds , embezzling public property , and striking deals between money and power .
the massive development of the western region will bene@@ fit future gener@@ ations , and it has a bearing on the great cause of revitaliz@@ ing the Chinese nation in an all-round way.It will take long@@ er@@ -@@ term , arduous efforts to accomplish the undertaking of massive development of the western region .
we are firmly convinced that under the leadership of the CPC , with the support of the people across the country , and giving full play to the superiority of the socialist system , the cadres and people in the western region will certainly be able to use their wisdom and exer@@ t themselves to build a prosperous hom@@ el@@ and with social progress , a stable life , national unity , and beau@@ ti@@ ful rivers and mountain@@ s .
Guangzhou Military Region is using test be@@ ds as the vanguard to lead its advan@@ ce@@ .It is using its focus on difficult points and attac@@ king key problems to promote all-@@ around progres@@ s.I@@ t is gradually making S &amp; T training for troops standardized and scientific , and it has seen clear improv@@ ements in the quality of unit military training and in the level of combat power of its units .
how can S &amp; T training for troops be made scientific ?
Guangzhou Military Region guided its officers and soldiers in adop@@ ting a concept of scientific training based on the demands of actual combat as the impetus , talented people as the foundation , S &amp; T as the gui@@ de , the masses as the main body , and standardized execution of training .
these train@@ ers emplo@@ y new knowledge , new skills , new methods , and new measures as they exec@@ ute 84@@ 7 outstanding training subjects .
the Military Region also unified and standardized training content , methods , evaluation , e@@ t@@ c . , and put a great deal of effort into implementing evaluation of military training levels , strengthening quality control of S &amp; T training for troops , and over@@ coming the practice of doing what one ple@@ ases in training .
the Military Regi@@ on@@ 抯 efforts were effective in improving the quality of S &amp; T training for troop@@ s.In S &amp; T training for troops , the Guangzhou Military Region emphasizes trans@@ formation of the results of the training .
through the spread of training achievements , the achievements are trans@@ formed into overall unit combat power@@ .@@ Since last year the Military Region has convened three on@@ site demonstr@@ ations of S &amp; T training to research and discuss the S &amp; T train@@ ing@@ 抯 new training methods and new combat methods .
over 600 innovations were manif@@ ested on the training gr@@ ound@@ .@@ Among these , innovations in military region command autom@@ ation and in ar@@ ti@@ ll@@ ery digitization are in the lead in the entire Ar@@ my@@ .T@@ ac@@ tical training made new breakthrough@@ s.@@ Se@@ a cross@@ ing and amp@@ hib@@ ious land@@ ing operations , electronic warfare , counter@@ ing air r@@ ai@@ ds , new 搕@@ h@@ ree attacks and three def@@ ens@@ es and other key , difficult subjects under@@ went testing in exercises similar to re@@ al war .
on a foundation of exten@@ sive development of S &amp; T training for troops , the Military Region in an organized way guided units to be active in prob@@ ing for , res@@ ear@@ ch@@ ing , and discus@@ sing the demands of local war under high-tech conditions , the effect of the development of the socialist market economy on the driving force of training of officers and soldiers , what difficulties remain@@ ed in training itself , and other issues , and to find corresponding countermeasures and methods .
Shanghai , 1 Feb ( ZXS ) -- A@@ t the first Shanghai International Industr@@ ial Fair held at the end of last year , results of development in the fields of high technology , electronic information , electrical equipment , biomedicine , and new materials vividly revealed the new face of Shanghai &apos;s modern industrial sector .
the deep@@ er significance of this exposition lay in demonstr@@ ating that if China treat@@ s seriously the policy direc@@ tion fav@@ oring technological innovation , pro@@ active adjust@@ ment structures , and development of high-tech industry , this will not only revitaliz@@ e the old industrial base , but also will promote the overall improvement and upgrading of the nation &apos;s economic structures and enhance China &apos;s economic strength .
the revolution in science and technology that took place in the world economy at the end of the tw@@ enti@@ e@@ th century , com@@ pris@@ ed of information technology , biomedicine , new materials , new energy , and a@@ ero@@ space technology , brought with it an in@@ he@@ rent tendency toward accelerated development .
the high-tech industrial groups that gre@@ w out of this have gradually become the most important sources of economic growth for every nation .
against this background , if China is to be incorporated into the world economy , it is essential that we accelerate the development of high-tech industry , enhance the overall national strength , and improve this industry &apos;s standing in terms of the international division of labor .
in the course of more than 20 years of development under the reform and opening up policies , China &apos;s economy has under@@ gone a historic change .
in the 20th century , following the great agricultural development that occurred between the late 19@@ 7@@ 0s and early 1980s , and the rapid development during the m@@ id@@ -@@ 1980s of light industries such as texti@@ les and home appliances , as well as the ter@@ ti@@ ary industries , and with all the accelerated developments in infrastructure and basic industries that were seen during the 199@@ 0s , countless problems have gradually seen their solution in China .
in particular , China has formulated a great many policies and measures to promote the development of high-tech industry , such that today this industry has considerable scope and a well-@@ established foundation .
there are more than 50,000 high-tech enterprises in China , and 53 national high-tech development zon@@ es have been established .
however , we still have a situation where dr@@ as@@ tic surplus of low ad@@ de@@ d-@@ value , low-@@ tech products co@@ inci@@ des with insufficient effective demand for high-tech products , and the resulting structural conflicts are very conspicu@@ ous .
only by acceler@@ ating the development of high technology and its related industries will we activ@@ ate the qual@@ itative leap in industrial structures and technological standards and capac@@ ities that will trans@@ form China in the 21st century from a great industri@@ alized nation into an industrial power .
our reporter has learned from relevant sources within the China State Planning Commission that development of China &apos;s high-tech industry will proceed in conformity with promoting economic and social development and stimul@@ ating structural adjust@@ ments and upgrad@@ ing.@@ Cur@@ ren@@ tly , three main responsibilities have been identified : -- To accelerate the coordinated development of the information industry .
in the 20th century , beginning from the early 1990 &apos;s , China &apos;s information industry has consistently shown an annual growth rate of more than 30 percent , and this ma@@ kes it one of the most rapidly developing sectors of the national economy .
within the next ten years , computers , electronic communications , software , and display technologies will all see significant breakthroughs , and the trend toward digitization , net@@ work@@ -@@ based information , and intel@@ ligent capability is already irre@@ ver@@ sible .
it is for this reason that the market out@@ look for the information industry in China is so optim@@ is@@ tic@@ .It is es@@ tim@@ ated that by the year 20@@ 10 this industry &apos;s market capacity will reach 6 tr@@ il@@ lion R@@ M@@ B .
clearly , development of the information industry will become one of the important forces driving economic development in the new century .
-- To speed up the industri@@ alization of high technology , and promote the mat@@ uration of new@@ l@@ y-@@ emer@@ ging industries .
after several decades of construction , China now certainly enjo@@ ys many of the conditions that favor accelerated development of high-tech industry , such as an adequate poo@@ l of human resources , and the requisite industrial base , technology reser@@ ves , market conditions , and funds penetr@@ ation .
for this reason we are selecting those key areas or key links that have favorable prospects , where the degree of industrial lin@@ kage will be significant , and which can drive the entire mechanism for critical breakthroughs , and through these we will vigorously strive to realize a leap in high-tech development .
-- To strengthen the as@@ simil@@ ation of traditional industry to high technology , and promote the improvement and upgrading of traditional industry .
traditional industry still has very weak technological found@@ ations , but while it is hard pressed to adapt itself to the int@@ ens@@ ity of international competition , it does still control the development of the future .
therefore , promoting the improvement and upgrading of traditional industry is one of the most important responsibilities connected with developing high-tech industry in China .
this type of inter@@ depend@@ ence and mutual stimul@@ us would be difficult to ignore .

M@@ os@@ co@@ w , 6 Feb ( Xinhua ) -- The Russian Federation Security Council , chaired by ac@@ ting Prime Minister Putin , recently approved the dr@@ aft of a new military doctrine .
the new doctrine stres@@ ses that when Russia itself and its allies suffer aggression , and a war aimed at destro@@ ying Russia cannot be stopped by conventional weapons , Russia has the right to use nuclear weapons .
this shows that Russia will be the first to launch a nuclear attack , when it believes it necessary .
according to the new military doctrine , Russia can counter@@ attack with nuclear weapons even if the enemy attacks Russia and its allies with non-@@ nuclear weapons , but they will never use nuclear weapons against other countries if Russia and its allies are not subject to external aggression .
the doctrine formulated in 1993 had laid down that Russia could only use nuclear weapons in response to a nuclear attack .
the background to Russia &apos;s formulation of its new military doctrine is the dr@@ am@@ atic changes in the internal and external situation in recent years and the ever-growing external threat that Russia fac@@ es .
in March 1999 , NATO set in motion its char@@ io@@ t of eastward expansion by formally accep@@ ting Pol@@ and , H@@ ung@@ ary , and the C@@ z@@ ec@@ h Republic as new members .
the three B@@ al@@ tic states and certain M@@ ide@@ ast countries are also eager to try to jo@@ in NATO at an early date .
NATO &apos;s eastward expansion posed a direct threat to Russian security interests .
after that , ign@@ oring the opposition of many countries , including Russia , and without UN authorization , US-led NATO wantonly waged a 78-day large-scale air war against the Yugosla@@ v Federation .
Acting Russian Prime Minister Putin specifically pointed out at the recent Russian Federation Security Council meeting that the new military doctrine is &quot; a rep@@ ly to NATO . &quot;
this means that Russia now regards US-led NATO as its &quot; no . 1 imag@@ inary enemy . &quot;
Y@@ es@@ h@@ in , director of the Military Construction Bureau of the council , said that due to its economic difficulties and shortage of military funds , Russia cannot fight a conventional war with NATO for the fo@@ res@@ ee@@ able future .
in order to be respected by others , it is essential to maintain nuclear potential and regard nuclear weapons as &quot; political instr@@ uments for cur@@ b@@ ing the enemy . &quot;
Intern@@ ally , the separatist activities of the illegal Chechen mil@@ i@@ ti@@ a threaten regional security and the sovereignty and territorial integrity of the Russian Federation .
all kinds of g@@ ang crimes have become a major fac@@ tor affecting social stability and economic growth .
military experts point out that un@@ less the Russian authorities send in their armed forces , it is hardly imag@@ in@@ able that victory could be won in the Chechen war .
Hence , the military doctrine by which the Russian armed forces were only used to deal with external aggression no longer su@@ its today &apos;s reality .
military analysts here believe that the new Russian military doctrine is an expansion and exten@@ sion in the military sphere of the &quot; Russian security concept &quot; which was adopted in January , and is also a &quot; war warning . &quot;
NATO will think thr@@ ice about taking major military action again that threatens Russia and its allies .
Nuclear arms will play a still greater deter@@ rent role as the &quot; tr@@ ump car@@ ds &quot; preserving Russia &apos;s great power status and vital interests .

leaders of respective places and units are convinced that General Secretary Jiang Zemin &apos;s important speech has penetr@@ atingly analyzed the current situation and existing problems in party building from the strategic level of initi@@ ating a great project to improve the party , has inci@@ sively explained the great significance and ut@@ most importance of tightening party discipline under the new situation , has put forward demands for tightening party discipline , and has clearly pointed out direc@@ tions for improving the party &apos;s style of work , promoting the building of a clean and honest government and launching strugg@@ les against corruption .
in S@@ ichuan Province , the secretary of the provincial party committee and the governor have assumed full responsibility for improving the style of the party , building a clean and honest government , and fighting against corrup@@ tion@@ .They have divided this year &apos;s anti-@@ corruption work into 10 major tasks and 36 specific tasks .
in order to implement stipulations on for@@ bidding leaders to help their sp@@ ouses and depend@@ ents gain illegal benefits by taking advantage of their power and positions , the province has decided to grasp the following three measures : 1 ) clearly investigating the situation and taking the initiative to correct wrongdoings ; 2 ) having party committees and discipline inspection commissions at the higher level strengthen supervision and inspection and lay stress on solving those problems strongly opposed by the masses ; and 3 ) having party committees of various cities and prefectures and party leading groups ( or party committees ) of provincial level departments effectively grasp the implementation of regulations by members of various leading groups and cadres at prefecture ( or department ) level .
leaders in Guangdong Province have attached great importance to seriously investigating and handling cases of violating law and discipline in the financial field in the light of actual con@@ dition@@ s.@@ E@@ f@@ for@@ ts are being made to investigating and entering names of those cadres who have appropri@@ ated public funds for use by relatives , frien@@ ds and individu@@ al business operators without returning money for a long ti@@ me@@ .Those who ref@@ use to correct their wrongdoings and cause los@@ s to the state will be given disciplinary pun@@ ishment or be investigated for their criminal responsibility .

the results of the New Hampshire presidential primaries on 1 February are in@@ .@@ Accor@@ ding to the preliminary figures , U@@ .S@@ . Vice President Gore got 5@@ 2 percent of the votes , which on top of his victory in the Iowa primaries on 24 January deals another blow to Senator Bradley , his opponent in the Democratic party .
the New Hampshire primaries have consoli@@ dated Gore &apos;s f@@ ron@@ t-@@ run@@ ner position and further boo@@ st@@ ed his strength to win the presidential nomination of the Democratic party .
analysts believe that the New Hampshire primary means that Bush is facing a serious new challenge , and also shows that the struggle for the Republican party nomination is getting much hot@@ ter .
new Hampshire is situ@@ ated in the nor@@ the@@ ast@@ ern part of the United States , with a population of only ten million .
however , this little state occup@@ ies a decisive position during the presidential primaries , and not only can it make the next president , it can also b@@ ury the political prospects of presidential candidates .
the situation over the past 1@@ 0-@@ 20 years shows that most of those who gain the White House have won in the New Hampshire primaries .
former presid@@ ents E@@ is@@ enh@@ ower , C@@ arter , Re@@ ag@@ an , and Bush were all vic@@ tors in the New Hampshire primaries .
Gore is the only Democratic party presidential candidate in the past tw@@ ent@@ y years who has won in both Iowa and New Hampshire .
his campaign strategy relies heav@@ ily on the economic c@@ ard , ener@@ ge@@ tically tou@@ ting the economic achievements since he and Clinton took office as well as claiming that only he has the experience and the ability to &quot; maintain America &apos;s prosperity . &quot;
Bradley tried to turn the situation around in New Hampshire after his res@@ ounding defeat in the Iowa primary , but was in@@ effective .
Gore said that the New Hampshire primary was a &quot; cr@@ ushing blow &quot; to Bradley .
however , Bradley has indicated that he will not withdraw from the race , but will r@@ ally his forces and challenge Gore in the up@@ coming primaries .
the New Hampshire primaries have turned the original five-@@ man race in the Republican party into a two-@@ man struggle , with fight for the nomination being primar@@ ily between Bush and McCain .
McCain did not enter the campaign in Iowa , making New Hampshire his main b@@ att@@ le@@ field instead .
there he adopted the campaign strategy of &quot; concentrating superi@@ or forces , &quot; th@@ rowing more time and money into it than any other candidate did and organizing more than 100 vot@@ er r@@ allies st@@ ate@@ wide .
in the poll@@ s conducted before the primary , support for McCain exceed that for Bush for eight weeks in a row .
McCain hopes the victory in New Hampshire will be a spring@@ board to winning the presidential nomination .
during the campaign , Bush stated that his large tax cut plan re@@ pres@@ ents the interest of conservative Republic@@ ans , and that he is the only one with the ability to take back the White House in the presidential election in November .
he ch@@ arg@@ ed that McCain &apos;s tax cut plan was similar to that of Clinton &apos;s .
Bush indicated that the New J@@ er@@ se@@ y primary was only a &quot; stumb@@ le on the road to the White House , &quot; and that he was fully confident that he would win the Republican presidential nomination .
Bush has more in his campaign war ch@@ est than any other presidential candidate , and he has also established a nationwide campaign organization , recei@@ ving the support of numerous congres@@ smen and party offic@@ ial@@ s.@@ Bec@@ ause of this , Bush is still in a relatively strong position in the race overall .
McCain has been a congres@@ sm@@ an for many years.@@ He was in the Vietnam War , and spent five and a half years as a pris@@ oner of war .
he believes that , because he has served longer in government than Bush and also was in the Vietnam War that he is the best choice as a presidential candidate .
McCain adv@@ oc@@ ates a mod@@ er@@ ate tax cut , saying that the bu@@ d@@ get surplus should be used to pay off the national debt and for the social security system and me@@ d@@ ical insurance programs .
he has indicated that he would pursue campaign fin@@ ance reforms to eliminate money &apos;s influence in politics .
public opinion believes that in New Hampshire , independ@@ ents vot@@ ers -- who are ne@@ i@@ ther Democratic nor Republican -- account for as much as 40 percent , and this part of the elec@@ tor@@ ate played an important role in McCain &apos;s primary victory .
following New Hampshire , Gore and Bradley will star@@ t a new round of competition on March 7 .
at that time , 16 states nationwide will conduct primaries on the same day .
if Bradley continues to dec@@ line , pressure within the party may force him to withdraw from the race .
prior to the 7 March primaries , the Republican presidential candidates will also conf@@ ront each other again in D@@ el@@ aware , South C@@ ar@@ ol@@ in@@ a , Arizona , and M@@ ic@@ hig@@ an .
the World Economic Forum &apos;s first meeting of the new millennium held in the small t@@ own of D@@ av@@ o@@ s in eastern S@@ wit@@ z@@ er@@ land sp@@ an@@ ned six days and came to a close on 1 February .
about 3,000 well-known figures in political , economic , and academic circles from more than 100 countries and territ@@ ories embrac@@ ed the theme of &quot; New B@@ eg@@ inning , New I@@ de@@ as &quot; to discuss the future developments and prospects of international politics , economics , and science and technology .
the focus of this annual meeting is no longer on how to resolve the thor@@ ny crisis situation ; rather it is to explore the more basic , long-term issues in world economic development .
at the beginning of the new millennium , the participants took advantage of this gathering to explore new ideas and char@@ t a new course for world development in the new century .
in the more than 300 r@@ oun@@ ds of discussions at this economic forum , the participants discussed such topics as globalization , the development of science and technology , electronic commer@@ ce , the internet , gen@@ e@@ tic and gen@@ ome technologies , as well as terrorism , nuclear pro@@ lif@@ eration , po@@ ver@@ ty , environ@@ mental pollution , and corruption .
economic globalization has made the countries around the world incre@@ as@@ ingly more depend@@ ent on one another for economic development .
the United States &apos; economy has been the eng@@ ine driving world economic growth in recent years .
to date , that economy has sustained 1@@ 07 months of continuous growth .
in the &quot; new economic &quot; era , when information technology continues to drive economic growth , the United States &apos; economy continues to have growth potential , but there is also potential danger in their stock market bu@@ b@@ ble and soaring corpor@@ ate and personal debt .
for this reason , the participants paid special attention to the prospects of the United States &apos; economic development , especially whether it can continue to sp@@ ur world economic growth .
in addition , China &apos;s economy as a growing force to be rec@@ k@@ oned with in the global economy is another area that attrac@@ ted much attention .
at the special symposium on China held on the 2@@ 9@@ th , Vice Premier Wu Bangguo delivered a speech entitled &quot; China &apos;s Econom@@ y Ge@@ ars To the 21st Century &quot; and introduced to the participants the strategic key points of China &apos;s future economic development , which include the strategic readjust@@ ments of the economic structure and the implementation of the strategy to open up the western region and other grand plans .
Wu Bangguo said China &apos;s development cannot be separated from the rest of the world , and world prosperity also needs China .
upon joining the WTO , China will enjoy its rights but will also fulfill its obligations .
in view of the failure of the minister@@ -level WTO meeting in Seattle , many participants wondered when another round of multilateral trade talks should be launched .
British Prime Minister T@@ ony B@@ l@@ air said the international community should learn from the failure of the Seattle meeting and let a new round of negotiations bring forth more benefits even sooner .
he proposed form@@ ing an &quot; E@@ min@@ ent Per@@ sons Group &quot; to make plans for improving the WTO &apos;s work method and hoped a t@@ ent@@ ative program could be worked out by this summer .
at the same time , representatives of the developing countries expressed great concern for the wid@@ ening gap between the rich and the poor in the electronic age .
J@@ ord@@ an &apos;s K@@ ing A@@ b@@ d@@ ul@@ la@@ h II said in his speech that today more than half of the world &apos;s population is still subsist@@ ing on less than $ 2 a day , while the ric@@ h@@ est one-fifth of the world &apos;s population ow@@ ns more than 6@@ 6 times the resources of the poo@@ rest one-fifth .
South Afric@@ a &apos;s President M@@ be@@ k@@ i said that the information revolution brought by the internet has further wi@@ den@@ ed the gap between the developing and the developed countries .
he said that to narrow the gap , the developing countries must unite and take the same stand in the new round of multilateral trade negotiations to make it a bon@@ a fi@@ de &quot; development round . &quot;
at this annual meeting of the World Economic Forum , President Ar@@ af@@ at of the P@@ al@@ est@@ ini@@ an A@@ u@@ thor@@ ity described in his speech a construction blueprint for the Middle East after achieving peace there .
he once again called upon the international community to take step@@ s to sal@@ vage the peace process so that the Middle East people can look forward to a peaceful , f@@ ree , and prosperous new century .
this annual meeting was held at the beginning of the new millennium under fairly good world economic conditions , but K@@ la@@ us S@@ ch@@ wa@@ b , found@@ er of the World Economic Forum , said at the opening ceremony on the 2@@ 7th that people must not be compl@@ ac@@ ent .
the questions of whether the United States &apos; economy will once again over@@ heat , whether the weak E@@ ur@@ o can recover , whether the recovery of the Asian economy will be sustained , which way the Russian economy will head as it stands at the cross@@ roads , and how to balance Nor@@ th@@ -@@ South development and other problems still loo@@ m , and they are not problems the World Economic Forum can sol@@ ve@@ .They require long-term attention from all parties .
Beijing , 2 Feb ( Xinhua ) -- The China Council for Promoting Peaceful Reunification , the Hong Kong , Macao , Taiwan and Overseas Chinese Committee of the Chinese People &apos;s Political Consultative Conference , and the Huangpu Military Academy Alumni Association held a forum in Beijing on 2 February to mark the fifth anniversary of the publication of President Jiang Zemin &apos;s major speech &quot; Continu@@ ed Stri@@ ving for the Pro@@ motion of the Accomplishment of the Great Cause of the Motherland &apos;s Reunification . &quot;
Wan Guoquan , president of the China Council for Promoting Peaceful Reunification , spo@@ ke at the meeting .
he said that Jiang Zemin &apos;s major speech had deeply , system@@ atically , and comprehensively expounded the basic principles and policies of the Chinese Communist Party on solving the Taiwan issue and accomplishing the motherland &apos;s reuni@@ fic@@ ation@@ .The speech , a program@@ m@@ atic doc@@ ument and guiding thought on solving the Taiwan issue at the current stage , reflected the con@@ sist@@ ency and continu@@ ity of the Chinese Communist Party &apos;s and the Chinese government &apos;s Taiwan policy , which not only helped maintain the state sovereignty and territorial integrity but also respected Taiwan compatriots &apos; lif@@ est@@ y@@ les and wishes to be masters of their destiny , thereby attracting attention from the international community and winning support and respon@@ ses from overseas Chinese and from compatriots in Hong Kong , Macao , and Taiwan .
Wang Guoquan pointed out that Taiwan separatist forces as represented by Lee Teng-hui &#91; Li Denghui &#93; have ignored the interests of the Chinese nation , dis@@ regarded the wel@@ f@@ are of the 22 million people on Taiwan , res@@ or@@ ted to all means in a vain attempt to cut off Taiwan &apos;s ties with the mainland , to@@ s@@ sed off the &quot; two-@@ states theory , &quot; and int@@ enti@@ on@@ ally split China &apos;s territory and sovereignty , which not only undermin@@ ed peace and security in the Taiwan Strait but also ran coun@@ ter to the wishes of Taiwan compatriots for stability , peace , and development , thereby incur@@ ring the unanimous condemnation by all Chinese people and by the international community .
he said that Vice Premier Qian Qichen pointed out at a forum marking the fifth anniversary of the publication of President Jiang Zemin &apos;s major speech that the correc@@ t@@ ness , scientific nature , all-@@ embracing nature , and feasibility of the &quot; one country , two systems &quot; concept put forward by Comrade Deng Xiaoping have been fully proven in the successful implementation in Hong Kong and Macao .
China will practice an even more relaxed policy than the on@@ es applied to Hong Kong and Macao to solve the Taiwan issue under the framework of the &quot; one country , two systems . &quot;
he expressed the belief that through cross-strait talks , a solution can surely be found that will not only s@@ atis@@ fy the wishes and demands of Taiwan compatriots but also fully take into consideration the interests of various social classes in Taiwan .
the har@@ d-@@ working , brave , cle@@ ver , and wise Chinese people can surely solve their own affairs and will finally realize the motherland &apos;s complete reunification .
more and more Taiwan compatriots will finally come to believe that the &quot; one country , two systems &quot; is the best way to safeguard the interests of all concerned .
also speaking at the forum were Zhu X@@ un , chairman of the Hong Kong , Macao , Taiwan and Overseas Chinese Committee of the Chinese People &apos;s Political Consultative Conference ; Cai Z@@ im@@ in , vice chairman of the Hong Kong , Macao , Taiwan and Overseas Chinese Committee of the Chinese People &apos;s Political Consultative Conference and hon@@ or@@ ary chairman of the Taiwan Democratic Self-Government League central committee ; Jiang Di@@ an@@ ming , vice president of the All-China Taiwan Studies So@@ ci@@ ety ; Li Jia@@ quan , research fellow at the Institute of Taiwan Studies of the Academy of So@@ cial Sciences ; Lin Sh@@ an@@ yuan , vice president of the Huangpu Military Academy Alumni Association ; and Wen Q@@ iang , member of the executive council of the Huangpu Military Academy Alumni Association .
the forum was chaired by Wang W@@ en@@ yuan , vice chairman of the National Committee of the Chinese People &apos;s Political Consultative Conference and president of the China Council for Promoting Peaceful Reunification .
some 50 persons , including Z@@ hou Ti@@ en@@ ong , vice chairman of the National Committee of the Chinese People &apos;s Political Consultative Conference and president of the China Council for Promoting Peaceful Reunification ; responsible persons from departments concerned ; some members of the Chinese People &apos;s Political Consultative Conference who are in Beijing ; some not@@ ables ; and representatives of the Huangpu Military Academy Alumni , attended the forum .
H@@ ai@@ k@@ ou , 2 Feb ( ZXS ) -- Hainan G@@ overn@@ or Wang Xiaofeng pointed out today that since the establishment of the province 12 years ago , an increasing number of Taiwan compatriots have come to Hainan to make investment@@ s.@@ Taiwan-invested enterprises have made positive contributions to Hainan &apos;s development and construction .
in order to commemor@@ ate the 5th anniversary of the issuance of President Jiang Zemin &apos;s instruction on &quot; making continued efforts to promote the fulfillment of the great cause of the reunification of the motherland , &quot; the Hainan Provincial CPC Committee and government today held a Spring Festival forum here with Taiwan compatriots , Taiwan businessmen , and their family member@@ s.@@ Representatives from such organs and mass organizations as the provincial committee of the All-China Federation of Taiwan Compatriots , the provincial committee of the Taiwan Democratic Self-Government League , the provincial Association of Taiwan-invested Enterprises , and the provincial Federation of Family Members of Taiwan Compatriots were invited to the forum .
Wang Xiaofeng said : five years ago , President Jiang Zemin gave an eight-point proposal on developing cross-strait relations and advancing the process of the peaceful reunification of the motherland@@ .This was the Chinese government &apos;s sin@@ c@@ ere ex@@ pres@@ sion on resol@@ ving the Taiwan issue which struc@@ k a respon@@ sive ch@@ or@@ d in the hearts of the Chinese people at home and abroad .
however , in dis@@ regard of the sincerity of mainland China and the common interests of the Chinese nation , Lee Teng-hui &#91; Li Denghui &#93; made all kinds of moves depar@@ ting from the one-@@ China princi@@ ple@@ .@@ Last year he trotted out the &quot; Tw@@ o-@@ State The@@ ory &quot; in a vain attempt to split China@@ .This was strongly opposed by the Chinese people , including the Taiwan compatriots .
as the sons and daughters of the Chinese nation , we will surely realize the complete reunification of the motherland and the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation at an early date .
he pointed out : Taiwan compatriots have the glorious tradition of patrio@@ tis@@ m , which is the basic strength for realizing the peaceful reunification of the motherland@@ .@@ Taiwan compatriots will surely be able to make a correct choice on the issue concerning the future of Taiwan that is bene@@ fic@@ ial to peaceful unification .
in the mean@@ time , he also affirmed the contributions made by Taiwan compatriots in Hainan &apos;s development and construction .
he pointed out : since the establishment of the province 12 years ago , 1,@@ 2@@ 7@@ 4 Taiwan-invested enterprises have made investments tot@@ aling $ 1.2 billion in Hain@@ an@@ .@@ Taiwan-invested enterprises have made positive contributions to Hainan &apos;s development and construction .
he said : Hainan will put forward &quot; detailed rules &quot; for the implementation of the &quot; PRC detailed rules for the implementation of the Law on Protec@@ ting Taiwan Compatriots &quot; in line with Hainan &apos;s actual situation in an effort to realistically protect the legitimate rights and interests of Taiwan compatriots ; at the same time , we hope that we will make joint efforts to further promote and give impetus to the building of the cross-strait ( Hainan ) agricultural cooperative experimental zone and further pro@@ pe@@ l exchanges and cooperation between the two islands of Hainan and Taiwan .
representatives of Taiwan compatriots , Taiwan businessmen , family members of Taiwan compatriots and related organs and mass organizations gave speec@@ hes at the forum one after another .
Mr. Ch@@ iang Y@@ u-@@ ch &apos;@@ ang , Taiwan businessman and vice president of the provincial committee of the Association of Taiwan-invested enterprises , said : I am a Taiwan businessman and I have made investments in Hainan for many years.@@ I feel that realizing cross-strait &quot; three links &quot; at an early date and achieving unification is conducive to the development of our investment@@ .The statement made by President Jiang Zemin on promoting the reunification of the motherland five years ago is in the fundamental interests of compatriots on both sides of the str@@ ati@@ t .
Lee Ch &apos;@@ i@@ ung-@@ me@@ i , vice president of the provincial committee of the All-China Federation of Taiwan compatriots , said : President Jiang Zemin &apos;s speech given five years ago showed strong affec@@ tions and sincerity , having a very strong influ@@ ential power .
the reunification of the motherland and family reuni@@ on symbolize the lo@@ ve of compatriots and the basic demands of national s@@ enti@@ ments .
in the speech of K@@ u Y@@ u@@ an-@@ y@@ ang , president of the provincial committee of the Federation of Family Members of Taiwan Compatriots , said : the smo@@ oth handover of Hong Kong and Macao shows that the peaceful reunification of the motherland is a general trend and settling the Taiwan issue at an early date is in favor with the compatriots on both sides of the strait .
Cai Chang@@ s@@ ong , deputy secretary of the Hainan Provincial CPC Committee ; Hong Sh@@ ou@@ xiang , standing committee member of the provincial party committee and director of the propaganda department ; and Li Dong@@ sh@@ eng and Wang Q@@ i@@ ong@@ ying , vice governors of Hainan Province , attended the forum .
United Nations , 7 Feb ( Xinhua ) -- Rec@@ ently , the US &quot; Sitelatefu &#91; 24@@ 48 3676 21@@ 39 3676 43@@ 95 &#93; Association &quot; published an Internet article , entitled &quot; Kosovo : United States See@@ ks W@@ ays To Ex@@ tricate I@@ t@@ self . &quot; the article held that last year &apos;s Kosovo War has bo@@ g@@ ged down the United States in an in@@ ex@@ tric@@ able quagmire , and the United States &apos; European allies are not cooper@@ ating now that it wants to withdraw its troops from Kosovo .
it said : life will only become har@@ der if US forces are garrisoned for the long term in Kosovo .
I cannot help but rec@@ all two old Chinese say@@ ings after reading this article : getting en@@ m@@ es@@ hed in a web of one &apos;s own sp@@ inning , and lif@@ ting a roc@@ k only to drop it on one &apos;s own feet , which truly portr@@ ay the dil@@ em@@ m@@ a in which the United States is cau@@ ght in Kosovo .
last March , US-led NATO f@@ laun@@ ted the bann@@ er of humanitar@@ i@@ an@@ ism , and wantonly and indiscriminately bom@@ bed the Fed@@ er@@ al Republic of Yugoslavia &#91; FRY &#93; without UN Security Council authorization .
the 78-day military operation gravely tr@@ am@@ pl@@ ed on the &quot; UN Charter &quot; and international laws , and caused heavy cas@@ u@@ alties and property los@@ ses in the FRY .
for a period of time , the US government , public , and media bo@@ ast@@ ed en@@ orm@@ ously about their victory and were in@@ suff@@ er@@ ably arrog@@ ant .
however , as time goes by , some people have to ad@@ m@@ it that the sever@@ ity of the out@@ come of this war is unexpected .
now , quite a number of people in the US Congress and research organizations believe that the government had mis@@ cal@@ cul@@ ate@@ d.@@ In@@ i@@ tially , it thought that the FRY would succ@@ um@@ b without a fight after enduring a few days of powerful NATO military stri@@ k@@ es.@@ Un@@ expec@@ tedly though , the desired result was not obtained after more than two months of air strikes , and the matter was only w@@ ound up after it was taken up by the United Nations .
ethnic conflicts have intensified further instead of disappe@@ aring after US-led NATO troops were garrisoned in Kosovo in the name of UN peac@@ e@@ keeping .
not only have viol@@ ent conflicts escal@@ ated in Kosovo , but NATO troops have become the target of attacks .
the Albanian &quot; Kosovo Li@@ b@@ eration Army &quot; &#91; K@@ L@@ A &#93; sup@@ ported vigorously by NATO troops has per@@ sisted in its old ways , has conflic@@ ted with Ser@@ b@@ s now and then , and also const@@ antly has open figh@@ ts with NATO troops .
the &quot; Sitelatefu Association &quot; article said : now , the US Government is considering &quot; re@@ defining &quot; its Kosovo policy , and the core will be military withdrawal from Kosovo .
US Defense Secretary Co@@ h@@ en flew to Munich last week , hoping also to work on the European allies .
he complained : US forces serve as polic@@ em@@ en in Kosovo but lack the training required , and the US Government does not wish them to do such work@@ .The Kosovo situation has the tendency to get out of control , and the European allies should shoul@@ der more obligations .
according to US clai@@ ms , the European allies have agreed to garris@@ on police units in Kosovo , and will form a m@@ ult@@ in@@ ational force before April this year to up@@ hold peace in Kosovo , so that US forces can extricate themselves .
however , in reality , the European allies have no such desire .
European countries , be@@ sides Britain , lacked enthusiasm in the Kosovo military operation in the first place , and f@@ lin@@ ch from advancing forward now that they are faced with such a c@@ ha@@ o@@ tic situation .
some people even believe that the United States asked for it since it ref@@ used to he@@ ed adv@@ ice initi@@ ally and had made a m@@ ess of things .
people here op@@ ined : the pre@@ requisite for the United States to mil@@ itar@@ ily withdraw from Kosovo is the agre@@ ement of European countries to fill the vac@@ u@@ um left by US forces , but per@@ su@@ ading the European allies to help clear up the mess@@ y situation is easi@@ er said than done .
the United States has always wanted to become the world &apos;s big bro@@ ther , and has promoted power politics and hegemonism every@@ where@@ .If it continues to be its old self , it will not be able to avoid the dis@@ astr@@ ous roads of failure it took in North Korea , Vietnam , Somalia , and other places .
Hong Kong , 8 Feb ( ZTS ) -- The idea of establishing &quot; three links &quot; across the Taiwan strait , namely direct transport , postal , and commercial links , has been the urgent demand of the nongovernment public in Taiwan for many years , and it has now become an important var@@ iable for the candidates in influ@@ en@@ cing people &apos;s vot@@ ing trends in Taiwan &apos;s presidential election , and affecting the overall situation in the election .
the five groups partici@@ pating in the election will un@@ avoi@@ d@@ ably aim the crux of the election race at the question of cross-strait transport links and regard this as a prof@@ itable policy in terms of winning votes .
state President Jiang Zemin , speaking on new year &apos;s day , reiterated the guideline of &quot; peaceful reunification , one country , two systems &quot; and the concept of &quot; Jiang &apos;s eight points , &quot; and again rais@@ ed his two &quot; pinning of hopes , &quot; that is &quot; pinning hopes on the Taiwan authorities , and still more , on the Taiwan people &quot; ; he appe@@ aled for the two sides to hold dialogue and negotiations under the &quot; one China &quot; principle .
the nongovernment public in Taiwan widely believes that holding dialogue and negotiations on establishing the cross-strait &quot; three links &quot; is the best choice for responding to Jiang Zemin &apos;s new year &apos;s day remarks and is also based on Taiwan &apos;s urgent needs ; such a move can enhance cross-strait economic cooperation and also break through cross-strait e@@ strang@@ ement .
there are now 4@@ 1,000 Taiwan-@@ funded enterprises on the mainland with agreed funds exce@@ eding $ 43@@ .@@ 5 billion , and over 1.@@ 7 million cross-strait j@@ our@@ ne@@ ys are made by their work personnel every year ; and the inability to resolve the &quot; three links &quot; problem causes huge ex@@ tr@@ a co@@ sts for business circles .
the &quot; three links &quot; constitute a key which can open the mental block between the two sides of the strait and also promote mutual understanding ; after the two sides have gradually come to know each other , the people of Taiwan will be happy to accep@@ t &quot; one country , two systems , &quot; and thus peaceful reunification will be achieved .
she analyzed that foreign enterprises will certainly not come to Taiwan if they have to incu@@ r the cost of a much longer circu@@ it@@ ous rou@@ te when going to the mainland -- like M@@ at@@ z@@ u temple wor@@ shi@@ ppers having to de@@ t@@ our around Japan &apos;s ( Shi@@ yuan ) &#91; 4@@ 2@@ 58 09@@ 9@@ 7 &#93; island -- thus being unable to make any pro@@ fit on it .
according to people in the Taiwan airline business , at present over 3@@ .@@ 8 million passengers annu@@ ally are fl@@ ying to both sides of the strait to do business , view the sc@@ ener@@ y , or visit relatives ; at a conservative es@@ timate aviation business opportunities total at le@@ ast 15 billion New Taiwan yuan ; if air cargo volume , air c@@ ater@@ ing , aviation support services , aircraft maintenance and other related businesses are included , the figure could exceed 30 billion .
Hence , while the Taiwan authorities are clam@@ oring that the &quot; three links &quot; problem must be handled in accordance with the procedure of the &quot; national reunification program &quot; plan , airline companies which want direct flights as soon as possible have long ago sent staff to the mainland to investigate the market and have also eng@@ aged in cooperative business with well-known mainland airline companies ; they have also maint@@ ained good ties with the C@@ i@@ vil Aviation Administration of China , in preparation for direct flights .
back in 1997 Taiwan &apos;s China Airlines used Hong Kong and Macao air@@ ports as its spring@@ bo@@ ar@@ ds for cooperation with mainland air@@ lines for &quot; s@@ ing@@ le tic@@ ke@@ ting &quot; and &quot; through b@@ ag@@ g@@ age lab@@ els &quot; ; in the past two years there has been a rapid increase in tran@@ sit passengers and cargo there .
at the same time China Airlines has established an office in Beijing through its US-@@ regi@@ st@@ ered &quot; Sino-US In@@ v@@ est@@ ment Company , &quot; and it is now planning to set up offic@@ es in Shanghai , the main commercial city of central China , and Guangzhou , south China &apos;s b@@ igg@@ est window on the world , as its main b@@ ases for advancing on the mainland after direct flights commence .
Taiwan &apos;s Chang Jung Aviation , which is clo@@ s@@ ely following China Airlines in establishing an office in Beijing , will also soon establish an office in Shanghai .
in order to respond to the vast business opportunities in the future when there are direct cross-strait flights , Taiwan &apos;s Fu H@@ sing Aviation has spent a huge sum on bu@@ ying medi@@ um and long-range ver@@ sions of the European Air@@ bu@@ s .
Taiwan &apos;s F@@ ar East Aviation has sent staff to the mainland to learn the technical aviation terms which dif@@ f@@ er from those used in Taiwan , so as to complete all the pre@@ arrangement work before direct flights commence .
it is learned that all these four airline companies have stated that they will send aircraft to the mainland as soon as the Taiwan authorities announ@@ ce direct flights .
as for sea transport , all shipping companies hold that direct routes re@@ present the inev@@ itable trend , and it is absolutely impossible to ignore the important status and impact of the mainland &apos;s vast market in Asia .
at present the main Taiwan shipping companies have app@@ aren@@ tly completed their &quot; struggle for ber@@ ths &quot; and associ@@ ated prepar@@ atory work prior to the opening of direct sea rout@@ es.E@@ ven the govern@@ ment@@ -@@ run Taiwan Navigation Company , which has never operated regul@@ ar container services , has decided to take back two multi@@ purpose container ships that it has le@@ ased to Li Jung Navigation , in preparation for opening cross-strait container routes between three ports .
in the face of the strong mom@@ ent@@ um of cal@@ l@@ s inside and outside Taiwan for the &quot; three links , &quot; the election candidates profoundly realize that the &quot; three links &quot; are a major issue and an entr@@ ance tic@@ ket in the election battle , and they can only win people &apos;s favor by ac@@ ce@@ ding to their wishes .
regarding the ideas of the five candidates , Lien Chan , Song Chu-yu , Ch &apos;@@ en Sh@@ u@@ i-@@ pi@@ en , Hsu Hsin-liang , and Li Ao , on the &quot; three links , &quot; public opinion inside and outside Taiwan holds that although there are differences in degree between them , or that the feasibility still needs to be ass@@ ess@@ ed , all those who are out of office are show@@ ing positive initiative and there is no lack of bold innov@@ ative thinking .
Hsu Hsin-liang was the first of them to raise the idea of &quot; three links , &quot; and S@@ ung Chu-yu proposed &quot; immediately opening direct postal and telecomm@@ unications links , direct transport links can go ahead through negotiations &quot; ; both of them are some@@ what bol@@ der and more positive than the Taiwan authorities .
as for K@@ u@@ om@@ int@@ ang candidate Lien Chan , he has not yet produced a white paper on his mainland policy ; Taiwan public opinion holds that since the outside world regards Lien Chan &apos;s mainland policy as the yar@@ d@@ stick regarding whether he will go further than Li Teng-hui and move out of Li &apos;s sh@@ ad@@ ow , people are waiting to see what will happen .
in the past few years , though cross-strait relations have gone through tw@@ ists and tur@@ ns as well as stor@@ ms , tremendous changes have also taken place in this regard .
compatriots on both sides of the strait have kept contac@@ ting with one another , various exchanges have been br@@ is@@ k and frequ@@ ent , the investment by Taiwan businessmen in business on the mainland of the motherland has reached a given scale , and perio@@ di@@ c progress has been made in promoting the establishment of direct links between the two sides for postal , trade , and air and shipping services .
all this el@@ o@@ qu@@ ently prov@@ es that the desire of the Chinese people to realize the reunification of the motherland is an irresistible historical trend .
Hong Kong and Macao have succes@@ sively returned to the motherland , and the historic task of striving to settle the Taiwan issue and realizing the reunification of the motherland at an early date is now ever more prominently placed before us .
as we mark the fifth anniversary of the publication of President Jiang Zemin &apos;s eight-point proposal , we should realize that one of the important historic missions is to carry forward the cause and for@@ ge ahead into the future and to further implement the great principle of &quot; peaceful reunification and one country , two systems &quot; to speed up the process of peaceful cross-strait reunification .
Hong Kong and Macao have returned to the motherland one after the other , and the influence produced by the practice of &quot; one country , two systems &quot; has been continuously increasing .
now more and more people favor &quot; one country , two system &quot; ; since it has successfully solved the Hong Kong and Macao questions , it can certainly apply to settle the Taiwan issue .
of course , comp@@ ared with the return of Hong Kong and Macao to the motherland , the process of applying &quot; peaceful reunification and one country , two systems &quot; to Taiwan will be more complicated .
the main causes are the Taiwan authorities &apos; obstacles and mis@@ lead@@ ing.@@ P@@ ut@@ ting on the air@@ s of stub@@ born@@ ly rejec@@ ting the principle of &quot; one country , two systems , &quot; the Taiwan authorities have v@@ il@@ ified it as d@@ warf@@ ing Taiwan , claiming that &quot; Taiwan is not Hong Kong , and &apos; one country , two systems &apos; does apply to Taiwan . &quot;
in fact , realizing the ultimate reunification of the country according to the principle of &quot; peaceful reunification and one country , two systems &quot; will not impose ex@@ ac@@ tly the same pattern of &quot; one country , two systems &quot; for Hong Kong and Macao on Taiwan .
in his speech at a Spring Festival te@@ a party for members of the National Committee of the Chinese People &apos;s Political Consultative Conference ( CPPCC ) this year , President Jiang Zemin pointed out : we pay close attention to the characteristics of Taiwan that are different from those of Hong Kong and Macao .
the content of settling the Taiwan issue and achieving peaceful reunification according to the principle of &quot; one country , two systems &quot; will be more relaxed than that for Hong Kong and Macao .
vice Premier Qian Qichen also expl@@ ic@@ it@@ ly pointed out in a speech : &quot; realizing peaceful cross-strait reunification according the principle of &apos; one country , two systems &apos; in the future will not harm the immedi@@ ate and long-term interests of the Taiwan compat@@ ri@@ ot@@ s.M@@ any Taiwan compatriots hope to maintain the status quo ; for them , &apos; one country , two systems &apos; is the best method to maintain the status quo . &quot;
&quot; peaceful reunification and one country , two systems &quot; means seeking a plan accep@@ table to both sides of the strait through benign inter@@ action and by seeking common ground while reser@@ ving differences .
in the course of &quot; equal consultation and mutual discussion on reunification &quot; as called by Wang Da@@ o@@ h@@ an , chairman of the Association for R@@ el@@ ations Ac@@ ross the Taiwan Strait ( A@@ R@@ A@@ TS ) , everything possible should be done to maintain the status quo and to not harm the fundamental interests of the parties concerned .
after reunification , the two sides of the strait will coexist peacefully , and &quot; no one will s@@ wal@@ low the other . &quot;
to bring about such a &quot; doub@@ le@@ - or multi@@ ple@@ -@@ win &quot; situation , the most feasible pattern is &quot; one country , two systems . &quot;
in all fair@@ ness , since the principle of &quot; peaceful reunification and one country , two systems &quot; was established , the mainland of the motherland has made continuous efforts to improve the principle and always given full consideration to the current situations on both sides of the strait and to the interests of various parties in the hope that the results of reunification will be accepted by the Taiwan authorities and the masses of the people .
in the course of cross-strait contacts over the past several years , the policy of the mainland of the motherland toward Taiwan , while up@@ holding the premise of one China , has emb@@ odi@@ ed fle@@ x@@ ib@@ ilities in many aspects : ( 1 ) The name of the representatives : &quot; equal consultation &quot; by the two sides of the strait .
( 2 ) The course of reunification : the objective of reuni@@ fying the motherland can be achieved step by step .
as the first step , both sides can hold negotiations on &quot; the formal end of hostilities on the principle of one China , &quot; first discuss the procedure for political negotiations , or exchange views on the establishment of direct links between the two sides for postal , trade , and air and shipping services .
( 3 ) Compared with Hong Kong and Macao , Taiwan may retain its armed forces and personages from Taiwan may serve as state leaders after its reunification with the mainland .
after the reunification , compatriots on both sides of the strait will be able to enjoy the dignity and honor of the country together .
since Li Denghui ( Lee Teng-hui ) dished out his &quot; two-state &quot; theory , the Chinese government and people have waged a resolute struggle against it in order to safeguard our sovereignty and territorial integrity .
the &quot; two-state &quot; theory has also been re@@ bu@@ ff@@ ed everywhere in the international community .
under the pressures from various quarters , the Taiwan authorities have said that they will &quot; not am@@ end the Con@@ stitution &quot; or &quot; en@@ act laws , &quot; but they have yet to get out of the de@@ ad end of the &quot; two-state &quot; theory ; they are still aw@@ a@@ iting an opportunity and attemp@@ ting to use other methods to separ@@ ate Taiwan from China &quot; legally . &quot;
the vital interests , major principles , and great justice of the Chinese nation require the reunification of the motherland .
it should be particularly pointed out here that the principle of one China is the most important basis of cross-strait relations .
it is precisely because the opportunity for reunification and the challenge to it coexist that we must make preparations in two aspects : ( 1 ) We should firmly adhere to the basic principle of &quot; peaceful reunification and one country , two systems &quot; and President Jiang Zemin &apos;s eight-point proposal and do everything possible to strive for peaceful reunification .
( 2 ) To prevent &quot; Taiwan independence &quot; and interference by foreign forces , we must effectively make preparations for safe@@ guarding the sovereignty and territorial integrity of the country .
D@@ r. Sun Y@@ at@@ -@@ s@@ en once said : &quot; reunification is the desire of all our nation@@ als .
when the country is re@@ unified , the people can enjoy a happy life ; otherwise , the people will suffer . &quot;
peaceful reunification accor@@ ds with the fundamental interests of the people .
only by settling the Taiwan issue according to the principle of &quot; one country , two system , &quot; will it be possible to seek the common denomination to the maximum of the interests of both sides of the strait .
of course , peaceful reunification cannot be accomplish@@ ed at one stroke , and the fulfillment of the ultimate objective may include the following stages and measures : ( 1 ) A@@ ny questions can be discussed during the political negotiations under the premise of one China .
as the first step , the two sides of the strait may first conduct negotiations on the formal end of hostilities .
( 2 ) Comp@@ lementary trade and economic relations : the question that will soon face both sides of the strait is how to promote the direct links between the two sides for postal , trade , and air and shipping services in the background of the World Trade Organization ( WTO ) .
( 3 ) In@@ cre@@ asing mutual tr@@ ust : the Chinese people on both sides of the strait are of the same orig@@ in , and there is no fundamental conflict of interest between them that cannot be resolved .
but the &quot; two-state &quot; theory is a stumb@@ ling block to the development of cross-strait relations .
whether or not the dead@@ lock between the two sides of the strait can be bro@@ ken depends on the at@@ ti@@ tude of the Taiwan authorities .
the Taiwan issue cannot del@@ ay in@@ definitely .
after the return of Hong Kong and Macao to the motherland , the Chinese nation will certainly be able to usher in a glorious , historical moment of complete reunification of the motherland .
British and US media recently have published many leng@@ thy reports and analysis on Russian Acting President Putin .
most of the reports are rep@@ le@@ te with s@@ kep@@ tic@@ ism over this Russian strong@@ man .
for example , both The W@@ as@@ hing@@ ton Po@@ st of the United States and The Daily Telegraph of Britain have portr@@ ayed Putin as a &quot; dangerous figure &quot; who may bring the world back to the Cold War perio@@ d@@ .They say Putin is &quot; playing a new nuclear so@@ c@@ cer g@@ ame &quot; and attempts to use nuclear policy to threaten the security interests of the West .
the media of the West maintain that Russia , under its new national security concept , has loo@@ sen@@ ed its control of the conditions for using nuclear weapons , and has even clearly regarded the US-led Western bloc as a &quot; hosti@@ le force . &quot;
on the eve of the disintegration of the Soviet Union not so long ago , the highly ide@@ al@@ is@@ tic G@@ orb@@ ac@@ he@@ v firmly believed the Western theory about &quot; common values of all mankind . &quot; his belief resul@@ ted in the disintegration of the Soviet Union and the dis@@ solution of the Warsaw Pac@@ t@@ .The foundation built over several decades was almost tot@@ ally destroyed immediately .
the United States , however , did not respond in kind to dis@@ solve the military bloc of NATO on the basis of the &quot; common values of all mankind . &quot;
following the disintegration of the Soviet Union , the Russian Federation again faced the danger of yet another disintegration because of the &quot; phenomenon of Chechen , &quot; which is a nation within a nation . &quot;
now Russia has become more so@@ ber@@ ly aware of its fundamental interests than ever before .
we should say that Russia &apos;s major restructuring of its external security system is a response , which Russia is forced to make because of the West &apos;s ins@@ ati@@ able , step-by-step moves to squeeze its strategic space , and absolutely not because of Russia &apos;s bel@@ lic@@ osity .
in the late 1990 &apos;s , the so-called &quot; common values of all mankind &quot; which the West pro@@ claimed ev@@ ol@@ ved to become the theory that &quot; human rights take precedence over sovereignty . &quot;
the fact is that this theory is nothing but a hy@@ po@@ critical sub@@ ter@@ f@@ ug@@ e.@@ Wh@@ o in those developed countries with strong economic growth and la@@ v@@ ish con@@ su@@ mp@@ tion ha@@ b@@ its have given any food to the star@@ ving Afric@@ an children strugg@@ ling on the line of de@@ ath , b@@ asing on the belief that that &quot; human rights take precedence over sovereignty &quot; ?
two recent events taking places respectively in Britain and the United States can fully expl@@ ain what s@@ or@@ t of the theory -- &quot; human rights take precedence over sovereignty &quot; -- it is when it is applied in actual practice .
the first one was Britain &apos;s rele@@ ase of Ch@@ ile &apos;s former president , Pinochet .
just as The Daily Telegraph says in a commentary , if Britain , on the basis of the belief that &quot; human rights take precedence over sovereignty , &quot; in@@ sisted on extraditing the former Ch@@ il@@ e@@ an president to Spain for tr@@ ail , it would means that a former British prim@@ e minister , when he tra@@ vels in a third country , might be ar@@ rest@@ ed there because of his conduct in another country .
thus , extraditing Pinochet to Spain would be an extremely complex and sensitive international event , and Britain , after considering the issue very carefully , d@@ ared not set this dangerous precedence .
the second inci@@ d@@ ence was : when Chechen &apos;s sec@@ essi@@ onist force was at the critical point where its very existence was at st@@ ake , and sou@@ ght help , even military intervention , from the United States , the US Government , while expressing profound symp@@ ath@@ ies , fl@@ at@@ ly rejec@@ ted the request .
the US Government has been strongly condem@@ ning Russian troops for creating a &quot; humanitar@@ ian crisis &quot; in Chechen .
if the United States chose to act according to the theory that &quot; human rights take precedence over sovereignty , &quot; then it should feel jus@@ tify to send troops to Chechen , just as it did when it inv@@ aded Yugoslavia during the Kosovo War .
but American people fully understand what will be the consequ@@ ence of their intervention in the Chechen War@@ .They fully understand that it is not in the national interests of the United States .
many world events happ@@ ening after Cold War have vividly ill@@ ustr@@ ated this fact , namely : although globalization has had a profound impact on the world , the core of international relations remains politics bu@@ tt@@ ressed by strength and national interests .
while globalization has wea@@ k@@ ened the traditional national interests , it cannot replace the fundamental national interests .
this is because territory , resources , population , wealth , culture , institutions and other tan@@ gible and int@@ an@@ gible things are still dem@@ ar@@ c@@ ated by ethnic and national lines .
the wealth of the United States bel@@ ong@@ s to the United St@@ at@@ es@@ .The resources in China belong to China.@@ British patents belong to Britain .
national interests are still the basic principle that countries all over the world follow in making decisions or taking actions .
we may discuss and listen to the &quot; common values of all mankind &quot; that the Western world ex@@ al@@ ted in the late 1980 &apos;s , or the theory that &quot; human rights take precedence over sovereignty &quot; they dished out in the 1990 &apos;s , but we must not forget this irre@@ fu@@ table truth , namely &quot; a weak nation has no diplomacy to speak of . &quot;
in the early winter morning , the great desert seemed s@@ ound as@@ le@@ ep , and the whole area was in darkness as our cross-@@ country jeep dro@@ ve in .
after the lights were swit@@ ch@@ ed off , the jeep was like a small s@@ and@@ ba@@ g quietly waiting at a spot not far from the launching tower .
inside the jeep we were enjoying the darkness , because no one could find us .
of course , apart from myself , they were all on special security missions .
the date was 20 November 1999 , a day writ@@ ten in the glorious ann@@ als of the Chinese nation .
at the time , however , we were anx@@ i@@ ously waiting and wor@@ rying .
our vehicle was so close to the launching tower , and we could clearly see the long arms of the sh@@ in@@ y gre@@ en launching tower embracing a mil@@ k-@@ white new type of rocket pointing at the sky .
all kinds of thou@@ gh@@ ts were thr@@ ong@@ ing my mind at the time , but I did not say any@@ thing , I was afraid that the others in the vehicle were in a state of anx@@ ie@@ ty , for this after all was China &apos;s first test@@ -@@ launch of a spaceship .
do not think for a moment that I , a f@@ em@@ ale in the military , am st@@ up@@ i@@ dly brave , in fact I &quot; know what &apos;s what &quot; and I am familiar with the ve@@ ter@@ ans in charge of the spaceship &apos;s destiny .
I just wanted to watch the &quot; Shenzhou &quot; so@@ ar into the heav@@ en from ne@@ ar@@ by .@@ .@@ .
after the tri@@ um@@ p@@ h , I can finally talk about it now .
Wang Yongzhi &#91; 3@@ 7@@ 6@@ 9 3057 18@@ 07 &#93; is the chief designer in China &apos;s manned spaceflight project , and so far the missiles and carrier rockets designed under his charge have never failed .
this time , however , I saw at the launch site that there was a big question mark on his face , his heavy e@@ ye@@ b@@ rows were k@@ n@@ itted , and he was int@@ ently looking at the rocket and the spacecr@@ af@@ t.@@ O@@ n@@ ly his h@@ air@@ style indicated the person@@ ality of the main in charge : black and strong , and very ne@@ at@@ .It was not hard to see that this fellow of the Chinese Engineering Academy , now in his 60 &apos;s , has the heart of a young man striving for outstanding achievements .
it is no surprise that chief designer Wang attrac@@ ts young men .
his technical assistant Sun Gongling &#91; 13@@ 27 0@@ 50@@ 1 04@@ 07 &#93; is an outstanding engineer with a master &apos;s de@@ gree@@ .@@ When joining the project team in 199@@ 2 , young Sun received a notice of en@@ ro@@ l@@ ment as a space engineering profess@@ orial research fellow at the Ge@@ or@@ gi@@ a Technical Institute in the United States , but he st@@ aun@@ ch@@ ly followed chief engineer Wang and d@@ on@@ ned military uni@@ form .
I really ad@@ mire chief designer Wang &apos;s powers of attraction .
I asked Sun Gongling , &quot; Why did you th@@ row away the chance to get a profess@@ or@@ ship in the United States and chose instead to be chief designer Wang &apos;s technical assistant ? &quot;
&quot; things that chief designer Wang has correc@@ tly identified can certainly be achieved , and they can be done in out@@ stand@@ ingly successful fashion . &quot;
Sun Gongling &apos;s eyes were bright as he said this , as if he had already seen the spacecraft soaring into the sky .
he quickly added some@@ thing worth p@@ on@@ d@@ ering : &quot; a man &apos;s attraction lies in his wisdom and boldness . &quot;
I agree with this .
Qian Xuesen , the fa@@ ther of China &apos;s space effort , first rec@@ o@@ gn@@ ized and fav@@ ored Wang Yongzhi &apos;s wisdom and boldness .
that was in Jun@@ e 19@@ 64 , when Wang Yongzhi went to the Gobi for the first time to undertake the task of launching the first medium@@ -@@ shor@@ t-@@ range missiles developed by China itself .
during the test fir@@ ing , the missile &apos;s range was not long en@@ ough .
the experts considered how to ad@@ d more propellant to the rocket , but as the rocket &apos; fuel tan@@ ks were limited , it was not possible to feed in any more .
just when everyone was rac@@ king their br@@ ains to think of a solution , a young li@@ e@@ utenant stood up and said : &quot; if the propellant temper@@ at@@ ure is high when the rocket is launched , its den@@ s@@ ity will be reduced , thus the motor &apos;s th@@ ro@@ tt@@ le characteristic will change accor@@ d@@ ingly .
after cal@@ culation , if 600 k@@ g of fuel are un@@ lo@@ aded from the rocket , the missile will hit the target . &quot;
everyone suddenly looked at the young man &apos;s face .
the experts could hardly believe their e@@ ars .
someone said im@@ po@@ lit@@ ely : &quot; the rocket &apos;s capacity was already insufficient , yet you want to remove some of the fuel ? &quot;
they then took no notice of his sugg@@ es@@ tion .
Wang Yongzhi , however , was not re@@ conc@@ iled to this ; he thought of Qian Xuesen , the technical director at the Jiuquan launch site and a great scientist ; just before the launch , he pl@@ uc@@ ked up his cour@@ age and went to Qian Xuesen &apos;s house .
at the time Qian Xuesen was not very familiar with this &quot; young fellow , &quot; but after listening to his views , his eyes br@@ igh@@ tened and he joy@@ fully exclaimed : &quot; call the rocket &apos;s chief designer here immediately . &quot;
pointing at Wang Yongzhi , Qian Xuesen said to the chief designer : &quot; this young man &apos;s opinion is correct , and do as he says ! &quot;
it turned out that the rocket &apos;s range leng@@ th@@ ened after some of the propellant was rem@@ ov@@ ed , and all the three missiles launched hit the target .
Qian Xuesen rem@@ embe@@ red Wang Yongzhi from that time .
when China started to develop its second-generation missiles , Qian Xuesen proposed : let the second-generation people be in charge of the second-generation strategic missiles , make Wang Yongzhi the chief designer .
the iron arms on the launch tower opened up , and the long rapi@@ er in the cr@@ yst@@ al p@@ al@@ ace , out@@ lined against the sky , displayed its hero@@ ic posture .
on 16 July 1990 when China successfully launched its first rocket bundle at X@@ ich@@ ang , he had been the chief person responsible for its development .
I concentrated my ga@@ ze on a tall and straight rocket ; it cont@@ ained a great deal of new technology , such as that used for chec@@ king and dealing with fa@@ ul@@ ts , and it was completely reli@@ able .
the manned spaceflight project has seven major sub@@ systems , and each system has a chief designer and director .
Liu Zhusheng &#91; 0491 4@@ 5@@ 5@@ 4 39@@ 32 &#93; , chief designer of the rocket , jo@@ k@@ ingly said to me : &quot; chief designer Wang has never asked me if the rocket will work proper@@ ly , I really wanted to tell him that he need not worry , there is no problem with the rocket . &quot;
I la@@ u@@ ghed : &quot; good idea , I will tell him for you . &quot;
that day I told Wang Yongzhi what Liu Zhusheng had s@@ ai@@ d.@@ G@@ r@@ ati@@ fied , chief Wang smil@@ ed : &quot; I know Liu Zhusheng , he is very careful . &quot;
rocket director Huang Chun@@ ping &#91; 78@@ 0@@ 6 2@@ 50@@ 4 16@@ 27 &#93; said , however : there are over 300,000 parts of the rocket , and if just one of them goes wr@@ ong , it will affect the launch preci@@ sion and may even cause failure .
it seemed that the al@@ arm bel@@ l needed to ring for a long time .
at this time the launch tower was completely opened up , and the rocket and spacecraft were all displayed before our eyes .
what people wor@@ ried about was the spacecraft atop the rocket .
on 16 November I sat in a room with Qi Faren &#91; 20@@ 58 4@@ 09@@ 9 65@@ 14 &#93; , chief designer of the &quot; Shenzhou &quot; spacecraft and listened to his opinions ; he was well aware that I was in the general installation department , but he f@@ ran@@ kly told me : &quot; this spaceflight launch was decided by deputy director Shen ; if it is successful it will be due to wise and correct leadership , but if it fail@@ s I will have been fo@@ ol@@ ed by him . &quot;
Cur@@ ious , I asked : &quot; why ? &quot;
director Qi bl@@ un@@ tly said : &quot; in the past I did not agree that the first new rocket should carry a spacecraft , moreover this is a prototype and a joint training in space hardware , but now I am more and more confident . &quot;
the thre@@ e-@@ cabin scheme for the spacecraft was proposed by Wang Yongzhi .
it means : the orb@@ ital cabin is the place where the astronauts li@@ ve and work ; the reentry cabin is the spacecraft &apos;s control center , and the astronauts sit in there during the launch and reentry ; and the prop@@ ul@@ sion cabin provi@@ des energy and power for the spacecraft in orb@@ it and in reentry .
what should be done about the new carrier rocket ?
there were different opinions on this .
the spaceflight departments proposed : the risk of sending up a prototype spacecraft is too great , and we should have a good mat@@ ch to be on the safe side .
Shen Rongjun held that since they had already undertaken to the CPC Central Committee to &quot; strive for 1998 and ensure 1999 , &quot; they must be cre@@ dible , and they could send up the spacecraft in 1999 in accordance with the demands of the proper technology .
it all depends on human effort , and China must take a good first step in manned spaceflight .
Wang Yongzhi went to con@@ s@@ ult Shen Rongjun &#91; 30@@ 8@@ 8 2@@ 8@@ 37 7@@ 4@@ 86 &#93; : &quot; we should att@@ ach a spacecraft to the rocket , but what happens if progress on the spacecraft &apos;s motor lag@@ s behind ? &quot;
Shen Rongjun immediately flew to Shanghai and went personally to the Shanghai Sp@@ ace Technology Research Academy , which was developing the spacecraft &apos;s motor , to find out what was going on .
he investigated the technical situation and conducted serious analysis and study with the leadership of the aca@@ demy and the institute and with the main technical staf@@ f@@ .The unanimous view was that although there were risks , they would be able , through effort , to ensure the spacecraft &apos;s safe reentry .
the scheme was then submitted to a joint meeting of the &quot; two ch@@ iefs &quot; ( the chief director and the chief designer ) , and a consensus was reached and a decision made under the aus@@ p@@ ices of Minister Cao Gangchuan .
in the affairs of men , it always happens that a correct choice will determin@@ e your success .
and for Lieutenant General Shen Rongjun , deputy director of China &apos;s manned spaceflight , the pressure was very heavy , because he strongly adv@@ ocated that the first launch of the spacecraft must go into space and successfully return .
his deci@@ sion@@ making choice was related to whether this undertaking would succe@@ ed or fail , and he profoundly felt the great difficul@@ ty of his task .
China &apos;s first spacecraft was given the same &quot; Shenzhou &quot; by President Jiang Zemin personally .
Central Military Commission Vice Chairman Ch@@ i Ha@@ o@@ tian went to Jiuquan space city and told all those involved in the tests : &quot; there are three great events in 1999 : the 50@@ th anniversary of the f@@ ounding of the state ; the reversion of Macao to the motherland ; and the task which you are about to complete of sending China &apos;s first spacecraft into space . &quot;
this China &apos;s first spacecraft launch .
when the Jiuquan satellite launch site was starting construction in the late 19@@ 50 &apos;s , Shen Rongjun , who had just gradu@@ ated from university , vol@@ un@@ te@@ ered to go to the great desert ; by now he has taken part in and directed more than 50 missile tests and rocket and satellite launches .
he is a renowned spaceflight ob@@ serv@@ ation and control expert and also a launch contro@@ ll@@ er of great experience .
this means that he shoulders heavy burdens .
for him , every launch is a test .
but he is a a tough fellow who dis@@ pl@@ ays not the slightest ambi@@ val@@ ence in the face of risks ; his so@@ le pursu@@ it is to make the correct choice based on the state &apos;s interests .
on 4 O@@ c@@ to@@ b@@ er Shen Rongjun was told in a urgent ph@@ one call from the launch site that there was a problem with a part of the spacecraft &apos;s control system .
the following day he flew to the launch site and immediately convened a technical discussion meeting on whether to open up the craft to carry out cr@@ ash repair@@ s .
there were two diame@@ tric@@ ally opposed views : some held that the reentry cabin was sealed , and to open it up to look for the fa@@ ult could result in new problems .
others held that disman@@ t@@ ling the cabin ran the risk of a mistake in work on the ground , but if it was not disman@@ tled , although there were reserve measures , they would be running the risk of a failure in space .
Shen Rongjun resolutely decided : &quot; we cannot run the risk in space !
so long as the organization is ti@@ ght , and the measures effective , mistakes on the ground can be avoided . &quot;
the cabin was completely opened up ; in addition to solving the problem of the ab@@ normal working of the part concerned , they also discovered and solved other problems .
in the end everyone sighed with relief .
I looked toward the launch tower ; the ti@@ p of the spacecraft atop the rocket g@@ lint@@ ed in the dar@@ k desert as it mov@@ ed away from the tower . 13 November , the spacecraft arri@@ ves at the launch site .
I traveled to the launch site in site commander Major General Liu Mingshan &apos;s &#91; 0491 24@@ 9@@ 4 1@@ 4@@ 72 &#93; car .
the road was lined with tall Xinjiang poplars standing up fine , straight , and stur@@ dy in the desert , like sent@@ in@@ els guarding a narrow p@@ ath@@ .They gave people a feel@@ ing of exh@@ il@@ aration .
commander Liu was full of em@@ o@@ tion as he talked about the space city in the Gobi , and even the 18@@ 0,000 Xinjiang poplars were full of vitality .
two days pre@@ vi@@ ously , I and he had passed neat rows of ho@@ t h@@ ouses c@@ overing 1@@ 50 m@@ u , where c@@ uc@@ umb@@ ers , tom@@ at@@ o@@ es , pe@@ ppers and other se@@ as@@ onal vege@@ t@@ ables were growing stur@@ d@@ ily .
commander Liu said pr@@ ou@@ dly : &quot; we not only need to keep people here for the undertaking , but must also create a good environment for them to st@@ ay . &quot;
the car stopped in front of a large construction ; the spacecraft was just being transported in the sun to the rocket general ass@@ embly and testing plan@@ t.@@ We followed behind and entered a bra@@ in city .
apart from the tow@@ ering rocket , there were many machine sh@@ op@@ s and equipment of all types .
commander Liu introduced them to me in a very familiar way ; it was not at all easy for so many par@@ ame@@ ters to be accurate , and I was a@@ ma@@ zed at his m@@ em@@ ory ; I even wondered whether or not I needed to put so many hard to remember figures into a m@@ ic@@ ro@@ computer .
Seizing my chance well , I asked this &quot; master &quot; of so many personnel , in charge of the rocket , satellites , and the spacecraft , and also of the space city with its fuel , r@@ ice , oil , and sal@@ t , and vege@@ table bas@@ kets , to talk about his life .
Liu Mingshan is a good tal@@ k@@ er ; after gradu@@ ating from university he left for the Gobi , and now he has been there 33 years and has witnessed the launch of 33 satellites from the space city plus various types of missiles and carrier rockets .
he has a lot to say about &quot; everyone el@@ se , &quot; and he even told me that 100 percent of gradu@@ ates from the space city sch@@ ool go on to higher education , but he did not say a work about his own family .
I was surprised at this .
I took the li@@ ber@@ ty to ask : &quot; does your wife work here ? &quot;
&quot; no , she has departed .
I remember her with gratitude to the end of my life ! &quot;
at this moment , the winter s@@ un@@ light was on his face , and I could see te@@ ars in his eyes .
&quot; that is the way with life , she just departed . &quot;
he suddenly re@@ pro@@ ached himself : &quot; she cri@@ ed out several times that she had stomach p@@ ain , why did I not get her to the hospital sooner ? &quot;
I had a str@@ ing of questions to ask , but I could not tou@@ ch on his hur@@ t again .
Seeing what I was thinking , he said quietly : &quot; Renjin had stomach can@@ cer .
I can never forget her lying on the si@@ c@@ k bed , exh@@ or@@ ting me with her last breath : you must get the spacecraft into space . &quot;
that afternoon I went into the space city history m@@ us@@ e@@ um ; a ph@@ ot@@ o@@ graph of Liu Mingshan &apos;s wife Pan Renjin was on an honor board ; a seni@@ or colon@@ el , she was smil@@ ing , and she appeared young and very pre@@ t@@ ty .
she was an outstanding technical cadre standar@@ d-@@ be@@ are@@ r here , and also an outstanding party member , who had won many awards .
her main work here was to monitor the site &apos;s elec@@ tro@@ mag@@ ne@@ tic comp@@ ati@@ b@@ ility .
a w@@ om@@ an suff@@ ering from serious ill@@ ness who knew her f@@ ate clim@@ bed up and down the several s@@ core meter-@@ high testing plant , so tired that when she came off shi@@ ft she could not clim@@ b into a vehicle .
because Liu Mingshan was bus@@ y with work , he failed to notice his wife &apos;s con@@ dition .
she went to Beijing for a meeting ; she made a speech there in the morning , and was taken to hospital in the afternoon .
Liu re@@ members that tr@@ ag@@ ic day : 18 April 1999 .
in accordance with Pan Renjin &apos;s will , her as@@ hes were bur@@ ied in the Dong@@ f@@ eng mar@@ t@@ y@@ rs mausoleum .
this mausoleum cont@@ ains 6@@ 0@@ 4 people from the Gobi who rest in peace now ; through the desert ha@@ ze , they could see the motherland &apos;s rockets and satellites soaring into space and could hear the roar as the rockets r@@ ise from the launch site .
the desert wind blow@@ ing outside the mausoleum brings the rockets &apos; th@@ under past the neat rows of memor@@ ials , and there is peace after the wind has passed ; it is as peaceful as dre@@ am@@ land .
on the two rest days of the week , when things are quie@@ test , Liu Mingshan brings f@@ low@@ ers and stands alone before his wife &apos;s memor@@ ial .
in a man &apos;s life there is a kind of const@@ ant re@@ memb@@ rance of gratitude , there is one thought that en@@ dures for ever , and there is a kind of person who wal@@ ks alone .
Liu Mingshan is now alone , he shoulders the important comm@@ ission of the motherland and people to achieve the hope his wife vo@@ ic@@ ed with the d@@ ying breath -- to launch the &quot; Shenzhou ! &quot;
three red fla@@ res so@@ ared into the sky , and the launch count@@ down began .
I have come over from the hu@@ st@@ le of the launching site , and many times I have seen Lieutenant General Shen Rongjun and Lieutenant General Hu Shixiang &#91; 5@@ 1@@ 70 00@@ 13 43@@ 82 &#93; , who is now deputy director of the installation department , directing satellite launches .
this is so tense that it would stop the heart of anyone there with heart dis@@ e@@ ase .
however , they have the posture of gener@@ als , and they can dis@@ gu@@ ise their feelings and pull through , until the launch has succe@@ eded .
dawn is just brea@@ king over the launch site , and I am happy to see the rocket pointing at the sky ; &quot; good wea@@ ther , favorable ter@@ ra@@ in , and friendly people &quot; are all present , and probably nothing f@@ righ@@ tening will happen .
just at this moment , however , Shen Rongjun and Hu Shixiang have received an urgent report : the o@@ ce@@ an sur@@ ve@@ y ship &quot; Yuanwang no . 4 &quot; which is undertaking the monitoring and control task at sea has encountered a for@@ ce@@ -@@ 10 stor@@ m at l@@ ati@@ tude 37 degrees south in the South Pacific .
Shen Rongjun and Hu Shixiang exchanged views , then gave the decisive order : &quot; launch according to plan .
better that &apos; No. 4 &apos; does not monitor , but security must be ensured . &quot;
they swiftly rela@@ yed this from the launch site to the command center .
Ap@@ pe@@ aring before leading comrades of the State Council and Central Military Commission , although they felt great p@@ sy@@ cho@@ logical pressure , they had tem@@ pered their c@@ ool and stub@@ bor@@ n dis@@ position during many complex and dangerous launches , and become com@@ posite command@@ ers full of self-@@ confidence .
at 0@@ 6@@ 30 , the great desert trem@@ b@@ led , the fir@@ ma@@ ment shook , and or@@ ang@@ e fl@@ am@@ es lifted the rocket and the spacecraft with th@@ under@@ ous roar into the sky and into space .
B@@ el@@ ow the launching tower ab@@ la@@ ze with light , I bu@@ mp@@ ed into Major General Zhang Jianqi &#91; 1@@ 7@@ 28 1696 0@@ 7@@ 96 &#93; , deputy commander of the launch site .
he is bold and careful ; he st@@ ayed at the launch site during the launch .
in his view , manned spaceflight is a life project .
in 1997 , the day after comple@@ ting the task of astronau@@ t selection , he received an order to enter the Jiuquan satellite launch center .
he told me : &quot; any small mistake now will affect the safety of the astronauts &apos; lives . &quot;
on 13 November , I witnessed a huge iron h@@ ook instal@@ ling the spacecraft on@@ to the rocket no@@ se , over 90 meters high !
the spacecraft had already been fuel@@ led .
tense , my hands were s@@ we@@ ating .
but when I turned to look at Zhang Jianqi , who was directing the operation , he appeared completely cal@@ m .
I suddenly thought , he has demanded that the operators repe@@ ate@@ dly train their hand and eye skills , until the big crane can in@@ sert the wel@@ ding ro@@ d first time into the a@@ per@@ ture which only has the diameter of a 2 c@@ m be@@ er b@@ ot@@ tle top .
if they are as skilled as that , what is there to worry about ?
is there not a saying : the skilled are bold ?
I also saw here Xu Kejun &#91; 1@@ 77@@ 6 0@@ 3@@ 44 0@@ 19@@ 3 &#93; , chief engineer at the launch site .
the article he wrote entitled &quot; China &apos;s Fu@@ ture L@@ aun@@ ch S@@ ites Sh@@ ould H@@ ave Two B@@ i@@ g Technolog@@ ical Pro@@ g@@ ress Fe@@ at@@ ures , &quot; which was published in Z@@ ai@@ re@@ n H@@ ang@@ tian &#91; Man@@ ned Sp@@ aceflight &#93; magazine in 1995 , was prais@@ ed by China &apos;s famous scientist Qian Xuesen .
taking a look at him , Xu Kejun appe@@ ars like a military offic@@ er , sligh@@ tly bal@@ d ; deputy chief engineer Yuan has a full head of black h@@ air , his eyes display drive , and he looks able and efficient .
one is 30 years ol@@ der than the other .
chief designer Qi said to Yuan Jiajun &#91; 5@@ 9@@ 13 13@@ 6@@ 7 65@@ 11 : &quot; I took part in developing China &apos;s first satellite when I was 30 , and you are taking part in directing the development of China &apos;s first spacecraft at the age of 37 . &quot;
chief designer Qi Faren was giving Yuan Jiajun a chance to display his talent .
chief Qi said : &quot; I hope that there will be success@@ ors in China &apos;s space flight , with each generation getting stronger . &quot;
I asked Yuan Jiajun : &quot; do you know why the leadership chose you ? &quot;
he read@@ ily rep@@ lied : &quot; I have a clear idea of the technical plans and have considered them quite carefully .
I will not only fulfill on time the task as@@ signed me by the leadership but will ensure that it exce@@ eds the leadership &apos;s expec@@ t@@ ations . &quot;
from the most tense stage in developing the spacecraft up to the launch , every S@@ atur@@ day morning for 6@@ 8 succes@@ sive weeks Yuan helped director Qi in presid@@ ing over the wee@@ k@@ end management meeting ; these meetings coordinated the sol@@ u@@ tions to over 3,000 problems .
the evening before the launch , Yuan and the flight control group discussed things ti@@ ll 04@@ 00 in the morning ; they prep@@ ared 64 conting@@ ency plans for the craft , and although these were not used , they thought of everything .
it is precisely all this , it is precisely the selfl@@ ess contributions of those named and un@@ named hero@@ es that ensured the complete success of the flight of &quot; Shenzhou . &quot;
greeting the first dawn of 2000 , a national flag of special significance was ho@@ ist@@ ed over Ti@@ an@@ an@@ men S@@ qu@@ are -- the five-@@ st@@ ar red flag that flew through space with &quot; Shenzhou &quot; fl@@ ut@@ tered in the first dawn of the new year , to gree@@ t new gl@@ ory for China &apos;s space flight .
in the last 20 years , China &apos;s science and technology research has made achievements which have gained the attention of the people of the world .
however , many scientists and edit@@ ors have come to feel even more that the development of China &apos;s science and technology magazines has fal@@ le@@ n far behind the development of China &apos;s science and technology itself .
China &apos;s science and technology publishers have borne the dual pressures of a surplus number of science and technology magazines and an excessive emphasis on foreign appraisal systems .
at present China has almost 4,@@ 300 kinds of science and technology magazines , with almost one or more kinds of publications for each university , research institute , and professional associ@@ ation.@@ Limited in@@ pu@@ ts and the dis@@ per@@ sion of sources have to a great extent con@@ str@@ ained the raising of the academic level of science and technology publications , thus causing to a certain extent the lag@@ ging of China &apos;s science and technology magazines behind the development of international science and technology magazines .
in recent years , some domestic departments in charge of scientific research have shown a not@@ ably excessive emphasis on evaluating in terms of how many articles are published abroad .
the evaluation of scientific research personnel by many scientific research departments has frequently indiscriminately considered the publishing of one article abroad as equal to publishing one or more articles domestically , resulting to a great degree in attracting Chinese academic articles to publishing abroad .
according to the example of the Scientific C@@ itation In@@ de@@ x ( S@@ C@@ I C@@ D@@ E ) of the intern@@ ationally renowned citation system of the United States &apos; Institute for Scientific Information ( ISI ) , the number of academic articles published by Chinese scientists received by the ISI in 198@@ 3 and 1997 num@@ be@@ red 3@@ ,@@ 4@@ 75 and 1@@ 0@@ ,@@ 0@@ 33 articles , respec@@ ti@@ vel@@ y.@@ Among these , the Chinese scientific and technical periodicals published respectively accoun@@ ted for 1,@@ 50@@ 2 and 1,@@ 7@@ 0@@ 8 articles .
this means that in a period of 15 years , the number of articles published in scientific and technical periodicals domestically in China fel@@ l relatively by 2@@ 6.@@ 2 percent .
the ov@@ ere@@ mp@@ ha@@ sis on publishing abroad is not only di@@ ver@@ g@@ ent from objective reality , but also is not advan@@ t@@ age@@ ous to the development of China &apos;s scientific and technical journals .
this is because the comp@@ il@@ ation and publication that comes out of the ISI &apos;s citation inde@@ x@@ ing database is aimed at providing services for scientific and technical information , and the items c@@ ited do not all directly affect the concrete sub@@ st@@ ance of articles ; so as a type of statis@@ tical analysis produc@@ t , the influence itself of the data does not have an academic evalu@@ ative content and should not be de@@ emed the authoritative data for evaluating academic publications .
in addition , the ISI database manif@@ ests a notable regional dis@@ par@@ ity in regard to the number of publications sourced in regard to certain region@@ s.The number of publications sourced to certain countries or regions in the ISI database is not in conformity with the scientific and technological levels or overall power of certain countries or regions .
the reason we believe that the development of domestic science and technical magazines is extremely important is that , as a window for reve@@ aling scientific research results , science and technical periodicals play the dual ro@@ les of simultaneous exchange and promoting technological development .
if China &apos;s high-level scientific research results are for the most part published in foreign science and technical journals , due to the factors of cost and channels of distribution , it will be difficult to see that these results receive simultaneous first repor@@ ting domestically .
to address the objective reality of China &apos;s scientific and technical journals , the scientific funding magazine department of the National Commission for Natural Sciences Funding , in April 1999 organized and convened an international symposium on &quot; R@@ ais@@ ing the Over@@ all Q@@ u@@ ality of China &apos;s Scientific and Technical Per@@ io@@ dic@@ als . &quot; the scientists and personages from publishing circles who participated in the symposium conclu@@ ded for the most part that in the future , the development of China &apos;s scientific and technical magazines most certainly must follow &quot; planned b@@ ir@@ th , &quot; with the focus on raising quality .
in addition , the National Commission for Natural Sciences Funding and the Chinese Science Association have begun a joint provi@@ sion of set am@@ oun@@ ts of funding to 100 outstanding science and technical periodic@@ al@@ s@@ .This definitely will promote the further heigh@@ tening of the quality of these magazines .
in regard to increasing the ex@@ pos@@ ure of publications , the investment into China &apos;s science and technical publications has been by far insufficient .
at present , many foreign academic journals , because they have established specialized web p@@ ages on the Internet , not only have provided wee@@ kly content for articles to be published , but some have even set up links to vast information datab@@ ases .
these methods und@@ oub@@ tedly will expand the influence of the publications as well as the frequ@@ ency with which the articles in the publications are quot@@ ed@@ .At the same time , these methods will also increase sub@@ scri@@ b@@ ers .
in these respec@@ ts , China &apos;s domestic publications at present include only a minute number of scientific and technical journals , which are in an initi@@ al stage of development and aw@@ ait strengthening .
China &apos;s scientific and technical journals should ad@@ dition@@ ally fully pay attention to public@@ ity and distribution work .
Compared with the complete marke@@ ting net@@ works and contacts and advanced ad@@ ver@@ tis@@ ing methods emplo@@ yed by foreign publishers , the level of China &apos;s distribution work for its scientific and technical periodicals is still relatively backward , and this is extremely obvious in the existing 1@@ 48 English editions of scientific and technical publications .
as for the situation at present , China &apos;s scientific and technical periodicals must raise their overall quality and increase the progress of their international contacts , not only requiring the arduous efforts of edit@@ orial departments , but even more requiring the close attention and large-scale support of scientific and technical departments and people in scientific circles .
&#91; Cai Tongchen &#93; The new term &quot; Clintonism &quot; has appeared on the international scene since the Gulf war .
what is Clintonism , and what does it involve ? &#91; Jin Yinan &#93; Since Monroe was elec@@ ted President in 18@@ 17 , many US Pre@@ sidents have given their name to a &quot; doctrine . &quot;
for instance there was the Monroe Doctrine that &quot; America is America for Americans , &quot; the R@@ oo@@ se@@ vel@@ t Doctrine of car@@ ro@@ t and stick , the T@@ r@@ uman Doctrine of organizing the Cold War and en@@ circ@@ lement , the N@@ i@@ x@@ on Doctrine of nar@@ rowing the de@@ p@@ th of intervention , and so on .
the new doctrine of &quot; Clintonism &quot; has emerged since the Gulf war and the break@@ up of the Soviet Union .
there is no accurate defin@@ i@@ tion of Clintonism .
some say that Clintonism is US post-Cold War ne@@ o-@@ interventi@@ onism ; others say that this intervention has the lab@@ el of &quot; human rights tran@@ sc@@ end sovereignty &quot; st@@ uck on it ; and still others hold that there is nothing complex about this doctrine , it is just a way of expressing policy with bombs , and we can draw up the following list : in 1993 he launched air strikes against Iraq ; in 1994 he took the &quot; Mo@@ g@@ ad@@ ish@@ u action &quot; against Somalia ; in 1994 and 1995 , the inv@@ ading army reached the g@@ ates and forced the top@@ pl@@ ing of the government of Ha@@ iti ; in 1995 he launched air strikes on Serb positions in Bosni@@ a and forced the parties in the Bosni@@ an conflict to sign the &quot; Day@@ ton Accor@@ d ; &quot; in September 199@@ 6 he launched missile strikes against Iraq ; in September 1998 he launched missile attacks on Afghanistan and S@@ ud@@ an ; in December 1998 he launched the &quot; Des@@ er@@ t F@@ o@@ x &quot; air action against Iraq ; and on 24 March 1999 he launched the Kosovo war .
Clinton is the first US President in half a century to have done no military service .
now in the eigh@@ th year of his presid@@ ency , he has become the President who has issued the greatest number of air strike ord@@ ers in history .
under his command , the combat operations of the US Air Force have increased by 400 percent over the Cold War .
Clinton himself is not only ter@@ med the &quot; air strike President &quot; by public opinion ; his diplomacy is also described as &quot; air strike diplomacy &quot; in Western diplomatic circles .
even though no one has added color and emphasis in summing up what &quot; Clintonism &quot; is , his method of being quic@@ k to drop bombs or launch missiles has long made him the President with the greatest enthusiasm in US history for reaching his political goals by the use of force . &#91; Cai Tongchen &#93; Wh@@ at is the true essence of Clintonism ? &#91; Jin Yinan &#93; The most accurate foot@@ note to Clintonism has been provided by Secretary of State Albright .
what she said when s@@ ounding off against Joint Ch@@ iefs of St@@ af@@ f Chairman P@@ ow@@ ell in 1993 has already become a famous saying in US political circles : &quot; you are always tal@@ king about our super military forces !
but what is the point of having these forces if we cannot use them ? &quot;
the fi@@ ery Albright gave the true essence of Clintonism : &quot; use these forces , &quot; so that the world will know &quot; the point of possessing them . &quot;
this then is the post-Cold War world in US eyes .
since only one of the two po@@ les remains , they must certainly seize the opportunity to make full use of this po@@ le .
Clintonism is military hegemonism in a uni@@ po@@ l@@ ar world , which ta@@ kes US interventionist policy to the lim@@ its .
from the Middle East to the Balkans , from Somalia to Afghanistan , there se@@ ems to be no day when it is not interven@@ ing in others &apos; affairs , and no year when it is not w@@ aging war to interf@@ ere in others &apos; affairs .
in the course of its interv@@ entions , it has even created for the United States a new method of war : &quot; war without engagement . &quot;
its main aim is to take advantage of its air and technological superiority over the enemy and use hi@@ -@@ tech weapons from the air and sea to do tremendous damage to the enemy without coming into direct cont@@ act with the enemy &apos;s combat personnel .
the 78-day Kosovo war is an example of Clint@@ on-@@ style &quot; war without engagement &quot; and also mar@@ ks the peak of the Clinton Administration &apos;s demonstr@@ ation of the doctrine . &#91; Cai Tongchen &#93; Why did the person who took US military interventionist policy to the limit lower his t@@ one in the UN General As@@ s@@ embly &#91; UNGA &#93; , indic@@ ating that he lacked sufficient lung power ? &#91; Jin Yinan &#93; The problem precisely occurred at the peak .
the UNGA of September 1999 bec@@ ame a w@@ ater@@ sh@@ ed in expl@@ aining Clintonism .
at the UNGA , Western opinion univers@@ ally held that the United States would give a comprehensive exposition of Clintonism , which was very much in the lim@@ el@@ ight .
a previous New Y@@ or@@ k Tim@@ es article said that this was the most glorious move in US Balk@@ an policy in over 10 years , and that armed force was the only language that the Balkans understand .
Germany &apos;s St@@ ern pic@@ t@@ orial also said with irre@@ pres@@ sible z@@ est that NATO had reached the turning point in developing from a def@@ ensive alliance into an off@@ ensive organization .
Clinton &apos;s address to the UNGA on 21 September , however , greatly dis@@ appointed these people .
Clinton said : &quot; we cannot intervene everywhere in everything , &quot; and &quot; military intervention is not always appropriate ; there are times when political and economic pressure are more effective . &quot;
this low-@@ key address caused spar@@ se appl@@ ause among the delegates , in sh@@ ar@@ p contr@@ ast to his address in 1998 , which was followed by a standing ov@@ ation .
what happen@@ ed to this person who took US military intervention policy to the limit ?
to attack a Yugoslavia that had already been split up , the United States comm@@ itted nearly one-@@ third of its air strength , and its stock of air@@ -@@ launched cruise missiles was almost exhausted .
since production of combat planes such as the F@@ -@@ 16 has ended , there was a serious shortage of parts for r@@ ound@@ -@@ the@@ -@@ clock bomb@@ ing , and there was no al@@ tern@@ ative but to c@@ anni@@ b@@ aliz@@ e aircraft of this type in the United States as an emer@@ gency re@@ pl@@ en@@ ishment .
a shortage of flight personnel me@@ ant that they had to f@@ ly when already tired , and it was also necessary to urg@@ ently mobil@@ ize the reserve at home .
a US Air Force memorandum said : &quot; the combat units are in a difficult period , there are almost no sp@@ are eng@@ ines available , and the combat equipment is almost exhausted . &quot;
air re@@ fuel@@ ling planes , electronic warfare planes , and ground attack planes that were being used by the US Central Military Command against Iraq , and aircraft carri@@ ers used by the Pacific Command to cruise the western Pacific , were transferred to help in the action .
if the United States felt that its ability did not equal its ambition in a par@@ tial air war , how could there be any talk of the military strategy of &quot; simultane@@ ously winning two main theater wars ? &quot; &#91; Cai Tongchen &#93; The recent US performance in the Asia-Pacific region has in particular been a case of ability fail@@ ing to equal ambition ; what is the reason for this ? &#91; Jin Yinan &#93; When the East Tim@@ or crisis bro@@ ke out in September 1999 , there was no less jus@@ ti@@ fication for intervention than there had been in other places , but the Americans did not come .
during the &quot; missile crisis &quot; on the Korean Pen@@ ins@@ ul@@ a , the Americans ac@@ ted contrary to their moves in the Middle East and Europe by seeking in various ways engagement and negotiations with North Korea , in a bi@@ d for a com@@ pro@@ mise .
when Li Teng-hui dished up the &quot; two-state theory , &quot; he expected the Americans to pull the ch@@ est@@ n@@ u@@ ts out of the fire for him , but they res@@ ented the retainer turning into the master .
former National Security Ad@@ vis@@ er B@@ r@@ z@@ e@@ z@@ in@@ sk@@ i wrote in an article in the Asian W@@ all St@@ re@@ et J@@ ourn@@ al that Li Teng-hui should be made to understand that &quot; the United States does not like Taiwan making stat@@ ements based on assu@@ mp@@ tions , that is , assu@@ ming that if they prov@@ o@@ ke war with the mainland , the United States will come and res@@ cu@@ e them . &quot;
B@@ ad@@ er , former director of Asian affairs in the National Security Council , said : &quot; we have not undertaken not to st@@ int the blood of American soldiers . &quot;
when will the US military , which is ac@@ custom@@ ed to using ret@@ ain@@ ers , personally fight in the vanguard on behalf of a retainer ?
this is the objective reason why Clintonism can hardly be s@@ way@@ ed by people like Li Teng-hui in Asia .
its cau@@ tion and re@@ str@@ ain@@ t in Asia are also based on the following objective factors : first of all , there is no organization like NATO in Asia .
although there is the US-@@ Japan security treat@@ y , and the 100,000 troops under the US Pacific Command , it is extremely difficult for the United States to squeeze the countries of the region together and place them under its standard .
second , it is difficult to find an opponent and theater in Asia where a war could be completed &quot; swiftly &quot; and &quot; without getting in deep . &quot;
since the Vietnam war , all US military intervention actions have been ess@@ enti@@ ally character@@ ized by &quot; speed &quot; and &quot; not getting in deep &quot; and have been aimed at weak and small opponents against whom success is easy , and f@@ ou@@ ght in regions where it is easy to break off .
for Americans , military policy directed at Asia has consistently been the most difficult to design .
here it is not so much the &quot; vict@@ ories &quot; in the Gulf and Kosovo wars as rather the lessons of the Korean and Vietnam wars that play the role of historical experience .
as a result , the Americans are unable to apply the Iraq or Kosovo pattern to resolve the problems of this region .
a number of countries with highly developed information technology &#91; IT &#93; have emerged since the 1980 &apos;s , in the wa@@ ke of the as@@ y@@ m@@ me@@ tr@@ ical development of the world information field .
they exploit their mono@@ po@@ ly status in information resources and the related industries to impose IT control , penetr@@ ate by means of information resources , and du@@ m@@ p information products in countries where IT is relatively un@@ developed , so as to attain their corresponding political , economic , and military goals .
this is the &quot; information colonialism &quot; phenomenon which this article rais@@ es .
the high development of IT , and the full exploitation of information resources and the expansion of their volume have caused explosive growth in the amount of information in the world .
the total volume in 1995 was 2@@ ,@@ 400 times that of 1985 , and the volume available every day now is 6.@@ 5 times that in the whole of 1985 .
handling , st@@ oring , dissemin@@ ating , and using the ever-growing information resources has become an urgent problem in the world today .
political stability , economic growth , and social development depend to a very great extent on the production , dissemination , and application of information .
it is ex@@ ported like capital , as an intellectual property right ; the information business has become a new growth point ; and in addition the development of the information industry is un@@ bal@@ anced -- these provide a hot@@ bed for information colon@@ izing .
according to relevant data , in the global information business , the United States accounts for 92 percent of CPU output and 86 percent of systems and parts , and there are now 1@@ 13 million Internet customers .
there are nearly 3,000 large datab@@ an@@ ks in the world , 70 percent of which are in the United States ; it can be said that they control most of the markets throughout the world .
in this regard , the French complained back in the 19@@ 70 &apos;s : the entire French databank field is mono@@ poli@@ zed by the United States ; and in the 1980 &apos;s , Japan exclaimed : Japan may be reduced to the status of America &apos;s &quot; information colon@@ y . &quot;
for a long time now , international political activities and national and regional political activities have been limited within a certain scope , due to the impact of the volume of information disseminated and the speed of dissemination .
in the information soci@@ ety , international political and soci@@ o@@ political life is embedded in the computer information network , and all kinds of information media disseminate political events and information to the whole world as they happen , and it is no longer just politicians who take part in and influence politics ; political in@@ security has thus increased ; the boundary between national and international politics ten@@ ds to become bl@@ ur@@ red , national political security is affec@@ ted and hit by international politics in var@@ ying degrees , and powerful information countries control information and s@@ way international opinion , resulting in li@@ k@@ ely in@@ jus@@ tices .
the economy is the foundation on which a state and nation depends for its existence .
For@@ ty percent of the source of modern economic development and growth comes from the information industry .
thus , powerful information countries swit@@ ch from exporting financial capital to exporting information capital and impos@@ ingly occup@@ y the information field in backward countries , thus restricting the development of national information business there .
at the same time they pose a serious threat to the economic security of these countries .
the progress of IT has also spar@@ ked changes in the world military scene .
war planning will truly be &quot; the deci@@ der &quot; and &quot; the army that con@@ qu@@ ers without a battle , &quot; and the role of the armed forces will be not only to defend national sovereignty and territorial integrity ; preserving the security of information territory will also become a new function of the armed forces .
just after &quot; Windows 95 &quot; appeared , the A@@ ustr@@ al@@ ian Nav@@ y discovered that this software has a m@@ yst@@ er@@ ious &quot; black bo@@ x , &quot; and once on the Internet , it would quietly send mechanical information to the software headquarters .
and when a &quot; Windows 9@@ 8 &quot; customer regi@@ sters on the Internet , the system will autom@@ atically collec@@ t the information in the customer &apos;s computer , even personal di@@ st@@ ing@@ u@@ ish@@ ing data .
it is also connected to a vast databank which collec@@ ts information on customers , and when required , this databank can provide the customer &apos;s secrets to political , economic , and military organizations .
by means of an internal sequ@@ ence code , the P@@ enti@@ um III process@@ or can compar@@ e the customer with the information that he ga@@ thers and deci@@ p@@ her the identi@@ ty and personal secrets of the customer ; or they can deliberately leave an embedded vir@@ us , and inst@@ all hidden dangers such as conce@@ aled channels and co@@ des that can recover code ke@@ ys .
all this warns us that these sp@@ ies on the net are more fe@@ ar@@ ful than the &quot; beauty sn@@ ake . &quot;
at present certain developing countries mainly depend on CPU im@@ ports ; the Internet regions and names register T@@ C@@ P / I@@ P dissemination agreements are all in US hands and can be &quot; taken out and used &quot; by someone ; in these circumstances , the security of the computer net and its information can hardly be guaranteed .
culture is an important foundation in preserving social stability .
the people of a given nation in a given age are living in a certain cultural pattern and cultiv@@ ate their own human qual@@ ities .
norms of language , writing , bel@@ iefs , and mor@@ als have formed the cultural circle of each country and nation .
as the information net develop@@ s , countries im@@ porting information suffer powerful cultural blows .
on the international network at present , many valuable information resources are in English ; thus the English information on the net inevitably dissemin@@ ates to non-@@ English-speaking countries the mod@@ es of thought , behavior norms , and values of the English-speaking countries , dealing blows at their traditional culture , W@@ e@@ b@@ sites and internet b@@ ars have become the new loc@@ ations where young people receive education and enter@@ tain@@ ment ; how can they ch@@ oo@@ se the good and disc@@ ard the bad when confron@@ ted with a comple@@ x@@ ity of strang@@ e information on the net ?
this cannot but arouse concern .
in the information age , information has become a major strategic resource , the information industry has become a country &apos;s mainst@@ ay industry , information security has become the most important security el@@ ement , and the information net has become a country &apos;s important strategic infrastructure .
standing at the thre@@ sh@@ old of the 21st century , people do not have only feelings of happiness ; it is ev@@ id@@ ent from the un@@ even economic development and the countless conflicts and tur@@ mo@@ i@@ l in the 20th century that high technology is the core of the competition in all-round national strength .
the phenomenon of information colonialism will become an important motive cause in future war .
anyone who does not have information independence and sovereignty will not have true national independence and sovereignty .
without information security , there can be no national political , economic , and military security .
when mankind entered the industrial age , the Chinese nation had its fill of the bit@@ tern@@ ess of colonialism and sem@@ i-@@ colonialism , and such a state of affairs cannot be rest@@ aged when mankind ent@@ ers the information age .
chairman Jiang has pointed out : &quot; innovation is the sou@@ l of a nation &apos;s progress and an in@@ exha@@ us@@ ti@@ ble motive force for the prosperity and development of a country . &quot;
we should establish awareness of our own strength in information , tackle tough problems with the spirit of the &quot; two bombs and one satellite , &quot; follow the pat@@ h of an information industry with Chinese characteristics amid the great tide of world economic integration , intensi@@ fy basic construction of information resources , and speed up the work of manufacturing computer software and hardware in China .
we should innov@@ ate and develop our national information industry , especially the research and development of ch@@ ip@@ s and oper@@ ational systems , so that China can stand tall amid the world information industry .
we should establish the concept of standing on our own feet .
those who become masters are not subject to control by others ; we should fully exploit the global information network to strengthen the impact of China &apos;s information and open up our information space .
we must establish self-@@ def@@ ense measures .

Hong Kong , 10 February ( ZTS ) -- Since the enforcement of the P@@ at@@ ent Law in 1985 , China &apos;s patent industry has developed rapidly out of nothing .
on 11 January of this year , the number of patent applications across China t@@ opped the 1-@@ million mark , and thus China has entered the world &apos;s r@@ ank of big powers of patent applications .
China &apos;s patent industry has made considerable progress in such areas as patent leg@@ is@@ l@@ ation , patent protection , and training and international exchanges in patent qualified people in a short sp@@ an of 15 years .
particularly in the last two years , as China &apos;s market economic reform progres@@ ses , the number of patent applications at home and abroad has increased by a wide margin .
according to a briefing by a relevant responsible person from the State Intellectual Property Rights Bureau , the number of patent applications China handled in 1998 and 1999 tot@@ aled 1@@ 21@@ ,@@ 9@@ 8@@ 9 and 13@@ 4,@@ 2@@ 40 or an increase of 6.@@ 8 percent and 10 percent respectively from the previous year .
of the country &apos;s total patent applications , the number of patent applications by scientific research units and institutions of higher learning increased by 7 percent and 22 percent respectively , while that of patent applications by enterprises at home also increased by 6.@@ 7 percent and 20 percent respectively .
the vigorous development of the patent industry will play a greater role in China &apos;s future economic development .
an expert from the State Intellectual Property Rights Bureau stated : having superiority in patents is an important guarantee for g@@ aining the initiative in competition .
this will help provide economic restructuring with advanced and applied inventions and innovations in large quanti@@ ties as well as new technology , products , and equipment on the one hand and help the economy maintain relatively strong market competitiveness under patent protection , particularly it will help boost industrial competitiveness .
achieving a leap in technological development is an important target of China &apos;s scientific and technological progress and technological innovation and also the only way to ex@@ pe@@ d@@ ite China &apos;s modernization .
state Intellectual Property Rights Office Director Jiang Y@@ ing also pointed out : it will help vigorously p@@ ush technological innovation activities among enterprises , scientific research units , and institutions of higher learning to carry out patent work throughout the entire process of technological innovation .
although China has achieved marked results in its patent industry over the last 15 years , its patents are compar@@ atively limited in terms of technology , quality , and size .
first , the fundamental reason for China &apos;s limited patent size lies in its source .
the number of high-quality inventions , that is , inventions that can bring about relatively high benefits , is too limited .
this being the case , the key to solving the problem of patent quanti@@ ty lies in improving the scientific and technological level as a whole on which China relies for its patents .
otherwise , in a situation in which the number of research achievements to be patented is limited ; their quality is poor , and their capability to gener@@ ate profits is limited , problems that can be solved are always limited even though patent concep@@ tions are so well popul@@ ar@@ ized .
second , efforts should be made to solve the problems of improving the quality and efficiency of patent work , low@@ ering the cost of patent applications , and shor@@ tening the period of applying patents for inventions .
third , the actual protection of intellectual property rights should be enh@@ anced .
to spar@@ k the desire of scientists and tech@@ n@@ icians for innovations , it is very important to implement a pat@@ en@@ -@@ rewarding mechan@@ is@@ m@@ .This will help form a benign circle in technological innovation activities among enterprises .
to encourage its scientific research personnel &apos;s enthusiasm for innovations , the Shanghai Petrochemical Engineering De@@ signing Institute of the China Petrochemical Group Cor@@ por@@ ation formulated relevant provi@@ sions on rewarding patents and inventions , stres@@ sing that anyone who@@ se patent application is approved by the institute &apos;s department in charge of patent will be given an award of 700 yuan and that anyone who cl@@ in@@ ches a foreign-@@ related patent for his inv@@ en@@ tion will be given an award of 1,000 yuan .
the institute issued a total of 300,000 yuan in awards for patent applic@@ ants from 1995 to 1998 .
every time after their patent were implemented , patent holders would have the right to ac@@ qu@@ ire the payment for the implementation of their patented technology .
the payment will be issued cumul@@ atively to patent holders at a rate of between 1.2 percent to 2 percent of the actual profits generated by the technology or products formed through the implementation of their patented technology .
the publication and implementation of these numerous policies has thus power@@ fully mobil@@ ized the enthusiasm of the institute &apos;s scientific research personnel for innov@@ ation@@ s.A@@ s China &apos;s entry into the World Trade Organization is appro@@ aching , patent departments in China are facing greater pressures .
therefore , it is all the more necessary to enhance the quality and international competitiveness of patent work , further safeguard national sovereignty and economic security , and promote social progress .
news of success@@ es from the Daya Bay Power Station has continued to p@@ our in since the beginning of the new year : --@@ It generated 13@@ .@@ 46 billion kilowatt h@@ our@@ s of electricity in 1999 , creating a new record in annual output for a nuclear power plant . --@@ Guangdong &apos;s second nuclear power station -- the Lingao Nuclear Power Station -- which was developed with Daya Bay Nuclear Power Station &apos;s ac@@ cumul@@ ation funds , completed its building projects as sch@@ ed@@ uled . --@@ Two nuclear power generating units of the Daya Bay Nuclear Power Station recor@@ ded an a@@ ver@@ age period of safe operation of 84@@ 2 days , ran@@ king first in the competition for safe operation with the 5@@ 6 generating units of the same type of the Elec@@ tric@@ ite de F@@ rance . --@@ Oper@@ ation of the No. 1 generating unit of the Daya Bay Power Station , which had operated safely for 30@@ 7 days in succession , was suspen@@ ded on 14 January to conduct its si@@ xth reloading and overhaul .
in addition , the No. 2 generating unit operated safely for 3@@ 18 days in succession and was relo@@ aded and overha@@ uled as planned last year@@ .A@@ chieving safety in operation without suspen@@ ding the operation of both the machines and the reactors of the two generating units within a reloading c@@ yc@@ le , the Daya Bay Nuclear Power Station was in the best operation status .
why Is It Th@@ at the Daya Bay Nuclear Power Station Can Be R@@ an@@ ked Among the B@@ est Nuclear Power Pl@@ ants in the World ?
Liu X@@ ic@@ ai , president of the Daya Bay Nuclear Power Station , at@@ tribu@@ ted the achievement to the high starting point , the wise central policy decisions to import advanced and well-@@ developed 1 million kilowatt-class large commercial nuclear power technology and equipment comprehensively and build and man@@ age them in line with the international standards , and the long period of efforts of the staff to per@@ sistently conduct innovation , pursue excell@@ ency , and c@@ atch up with and sur@@ p@@ ass the advanced levels of the world .
establish the Mo@@ d@@ ern Enterpris@@ e Syst@@ em and S@@ uc@@ c@@ ess@@ fully Pro@@ be the W@@ ay of Scientific Management of Enterprises in Wh@@ ich the State Has a Con@@ tro@@ lling In@@ te@@ rest .
the two 1 million kilowatt-class nuclear power generating units of the Daya Bay Nuclear Power Station are like two &quot; money printing machines &quot; oper@@ ating around the clock , each of which cre@@ ates more than $ 1 million in output value every day .
the Daya Bay Nuclear Power Station ear@@ ned $ 5@@ 60 million in foreign exchange and created 2.@@ 3 billion yuan in profits and ta@@ x@@ es in 1999 .
with Such an En@@ ormous Am@@ ount of Prof@@ its , Is the Daya Bay Power Station V@@ ery L@@ av@@ ish in S@@ pen@@ ding ?
when brief@@ ed by staff of the Daya Bay Power Station , the reporters found that the briefing materials they used were printed on both sides while those distribu@@ ted to us were printed on one side only .
to feed our cur@@ i@@ osity , they explained that printing on both sides of the paper of materials for internal use was to reduce cost , and printing on one side of the paper of materials for external use was to show respect to their guests .
the sense of cost and the extent of meticulous management of the staff of the Daya Bay Power Station can be seen from this !
the official name of the Daya Bay Nuclear Power Station is Guangdong Nuclear Power Joint V@@ enture Company , of which 75 percent of the stocks are owned by the state and the remaining 25 percent by Hong Kong China Elec@@ tr@@ ic Power Company .
most authoritative in the joint venture company is not its president but its rules , systems , and procedures .
the joint venture company has strict rules , systems , and execution procedures for all its work , from the procurement of st@@ ap@@ le materials and the suspension , reloading , and overhaul of nuclear power generating units to the distribution of labor insurance goods and small gi@@ f@@ ts to guests .
if not per@@ mitted by systems and procedures , even its president cannot use a pen@@ ny or any material .
De@@ ga@@ i &#91; name as trans@@ lit@@ er@@ ated &#93; , a foreign expert who had worked in the Daya Bay Power Station , said that in a certain sense , what the power station produced was not electricity but doc@@ uments , because everything had rules to follow and was restricted by procedures .
implementation of rules , systems , and work procedures hing@@ es on man .
to prevent and correct the practice of ab@@ using power to violate systems and procedures , the Daya Bay Power Station has learned from advanced enterprise management exper@@ ti@@ se from abroad and established an auditing department directly responsible to its board of directors .
chief Aud@@ itor Xu Ch@@ uan@@ sh@@ un told the reporters that the power station &apos;s auditing department was not only a &quot; Mr. account ex@@ a@@ min@@ er &quot; responsible for past auditing of the revenue and the expendit@@ ure , but it was also a doc@@ tor in charge of the operation of the company and a risk advis@@ er , who carried out the internal control function and management auditing and had the author@@ ity to au@@ dit any department of the company .
the In@@ flu@@ ence of the Auditing Department Can Be S@@ een E@@ ver@@ y@@ where in the Daya Bay Power Station .
the joint venture company &apos;s Xerox machines were reduced from 53 to 36 last year because the auditing department discovered that the actual volume of cop@@ ies printed by the company &apos;s Xerox machines was lower than the sugg@@ ested volume of the machine provi@@ der , which was a w@@ ast@@ e of resources .
a Nuclear S@@ af@@ ety Culture De@@ ep@@ ly R@@ o@@ oted in People &apos;s H@@ ear@@ ts , a Protec@@ tive S@@ cre@@ en M@@ ore Sec@@ ure Th@@ an St@@ e@@ el@@ -@@ Re@@ in@@ forced Con@@ crete Nuclear Power is a clean and highly efficient source of energy .
however , 100 percent safety should be ensured .
the Daya Bay Power Station &apos;s nuclear reactors , which are of the world &apos;s saf@@ est type , have three protective scre@@ ens to prevent nuclear leakage even in earth@@ qu@@ ake or hit by a high-@@ speed small plan@@ e.@@ E@@ ven with such capability , however , the power station has still put nuclear safety first and never lo@@ wered vig@@ il@@ ance .
it has established a vir@@ tual protective screen more sec@@ ure than st@@ ee@@ l reinforced concrete -- a nuclear safety culture deeply rooted in people &apos;s hearts .
in the Daya Bay Nuclear Power Station , strict procedures should be followed even in repair@@ ing a simple valve : filling in a work s@@ li@@ p on what the problem is , by whom , when , and where it is found , and the dead@@ line for the repair ; writing an explan@@ atory memorandum in which the maintenance engineer writ@@ es down the position of the valve in the blueprint , its function , his opinions on the repair , and the br@@ and of the new valve to replace the old ; issuing an isol@@ ation notice instruc@@ ting personnel concerned to close down relevant systems ; and filling in a repair record as soon as tests are conducted after the maintenance personnel fi@@ x the problem .
the Daya Bay Nuclear Power Station has a clear regulation which per@@ m@@ its errors in work but not lies to cover up the errors , because lies will lead to still greater mis@@ ha@@ ps or hidden dangers .
on one occasion , leakage of l@@ u@@ br@@ ic@@ ant was discovered on a g@@ as tur@@ b@@ ine after a gr@@ ade@@ -@@ seven maintenance worker completed the overhaul of its filter screen .
an inspection showed that an insertion ring was mis@@ sing .
the worker said that he did not receive the insertion ring , but the power station &apos;s strict system of regi@@ str@@ ation of material inf@@ low and out@@ flow prov@@ ed the worker was lying .
the director of the production department immediately pointed out in a serious manner that errors in work were nothing to be afraid of as long as people clearly explained the true situation and took measures in a timely manner ; but those who lied and caused a hidden danger in production safety would be dis@@ mis@@ sed as soon as this was discovered .
S@@ ens@@ ing the seri@@ ous@@ ness of the problem , the worker ad@@ mitted that he dro@@ pped the insertion ring into the filter screen out of ca@@ rel@@ ess@@ ness .
the maintenance department immediately organized personnel to conduct analysis and study and adopted timely measures to eliminate the hidden danger .
since then , an atmosphere has been established in the power station in which people beg@@ in with speaking the truth when they want to correct an er@@ ro@@ r .
it is in such detailed work@@ flow , strict rules and systems , and the sense of safety deeply rooted in workers &apos; hearts that the nuclear safety culture of the Daya Bay Nuclear Power Station is reflected .
outside the main control room of the No. 1 generating unit , the reporters saw some bann@@ ers , reading &quot; do everything successfully at one stroke , make every person a protective screen &quot; and &quot; it is safety not the market that deci@@ des everything . &quot;
the nuclear safety culture deeply rooted in people &apos;s hearts has laid a solid foundation for the safe operation of the Daya Bay Nuclear Power Station .
in 1999 , the number of un@@ planned suspen@@ sions of operation of the two nuclear reactors and power generating units at the power station was &quot; 0 , &quot; and all the major operation indic@@ ators of the power station reached the world &apos;s advanced level .
using the Nuclear Power Station to Sup@@ port Nuclear Power Development and Achieving Continu@@ ous Development , the Daya Bay Nuclear Power Station Has Bec@@ ome the In@@ cu@@ bator of Guangdong &apos;s Nuclear Power Development .
&quot; using nuclear power st@@ ations to support nuclear power development and achieving continuous development &quot; is a principle that central leading comrades formulated for Guangdong &apos;s nuclear power development .
to su@@ it this purpose , the State Council decided to establish the Guangdong Nuclear Power Group Company to control the stocks of the Daya Bay Nuclear Power Station on behalf of the state and to actively use the capital and man@@ power resources of the power station to continuously develop Guangdong &apos;s nuclear power industries .
Zan Yunlong , the major pl@@ ann@@ er and buil@@ der of the Daya Bay Nuclear Power Station , was appointed chairman of the board of directors and concurrently president of the Guangdong Nuclear Power Group Company .
represented by Zan Yunlong , the staff of the Daya Bay Nuclear Power Station deeply understand and resolutely implement the central decision on turning the Daya Bay Nuclear Power Station into a incu@@ bator of Guangdong &apos;s nuclear power development@@ .They are building the second nuclear power station -- the Lingao Nuclear Power Station -- on the Daya Bay coast and are actively creating favorable conditions for the construction of Guangdong &apos;s third nuclear power station -- the Y@@ ang@@ jiang Nuclear Power Station .
the No. 2 reac@@ tor of the Lingao Nuclear Power Station was successfully built on 7 December 1999 , with the v@@ a@@ ult -- 37 meters in diameter and more than 16@@ 0 tonnes in we@@ ight -- of the nuclear island being s@@ low@@ ly lifted by a large crane and accurately placed in the pre@@ determined position to successfully connec@@ t with the body of the nuclear island .
by then , the building projects of the Lingao Nuclear Power Station had been successfully completed , and the main part of the project entered the period of installation .
as a notable distinction from the construction of the Daya Bay Nuclear Power Station , few high-@@ no@@ sed and blu@@ e-@@ ey@@ ed foreigners are seen at the work site of the Lingao Nuclear Power St@@ ation.@@ D@@ eci@@ si@@ on-@@ making power has been basically achieved in the earth@@ works construction of the main part of the project .
according to Fan Heming , president of the Lingao Nuclear Power Limited Company , who was transferred from the Daya Bay Nuclear Power Station , judging from the technological inde@@ x , the two 1-@@ mil@@ li@@ on-@@ kilowatt pres@@ sur@@ ized water reactors under construction were not a simple &quot; du@@ pl@@ ic@@ ation &quot; of the Daya Bay Nuclear Power Station , but are an improvement based on the technological foundation of the Daya Bay Nuclear Power Station .
in the construction of the Lingao Nuclear Power Station , however , Chinese personnel are the main force , and only a few foreign experts have been invited to serve as advis@@ er@@ s.The overall design , project management and construction , equipment installation and tests , and production preparations and training have been by and large conducted by Chinese personnel independ@@ ently ; and significant progress has also been made in the domestic manufacturing of the equipment of the power st@@ ation.@@ Fi@@ f@@ te@@ en percent of the total cost of the Lingao Nuclear Power Station is borne by domestic manufacturing enterprises , and the corresponding technological content is as high as over 70 percent , thus making contributions to domestic technological adv@@ ance and expansion of domestic demand .
in the construction of the Lingao Nuclear Power Station , the principle of &quot; putting safety and quality first &quot; has been strictly implemented , and quality , progress , investment control has been exercis@@ ed across the board to ensure that best quality and efficiency are achieved in construction and equipment .
in January last year , the company sent a group of experts , including two academ@@ icians , to Europe to inspec@@ t equipment manufac@@ tur@@ ing@@ .It discovered a quality problem in an important component which was being buil@@ t.@@ Fan Heming went to Europe immediately to discuss with the manufac@@ ture@@ r on production of a new component .
Zan Yun@@ lung , chairman of the board of directors and concurrently president of the Guangdong Nuclear Power Group Company , told the reporters with confidence : &quot; with sufficient capital and personnel resources of the Daya Bay Nuclear Power Station and independ@@ ent construction experience of the Lingao Nuclear Power Station , Guangdong &apos;s nuclear power industry has entered a g@@ ol@@ den age of development . &quot;
Beijing 11 Feb ( Xinhua ) -- Over the past year , in accordance with the policy of &quot; peaceful reunification and one country two systems , &quot; President Jiang Zemin &apos;s eight-point proposal , and the principle of intensi@@ fying exchanges , promoting friendship , expanding consensus , developing cooperation , and promoting reunification , the National Committee of the Chinese People &apos;s Political Consultative Conference &#91; CPPCC &#93; has actively carried out all kinds of work , extensively un@@ ited with Hong Kong , Macao and , the Taiwan people , as well as Overseas Chinese , and played an important role in advancing the great cause of the reunification of the motherland .
