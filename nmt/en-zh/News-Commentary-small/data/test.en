just a year ago , the United States had five major fre@@ est@@ an@@ ding investment banks that stood atop its mighty financial sector .
the first pillar of this system is the public and private economic monopolies that dominate the country .
a massive state bailout , while adding enormously to pressure on Obama &apos;s government , would expose the weak link in the US system of governance .
foreign central banks asked whether the Bank of England was contemplating changing its view of the pound &apos;s exchange rate .

yet consumers of energy services have no particular interest in what sources of energy fuel their production , transportation , lighting , heating , air conditioning , or appliances .
the European Central Bank must adapt to the fiscal pact &apos;s new rules .
the second key ingredient is multilateralism .
any negotiator knows that the parties to a conflict will be reluctant to make compromises unless there is a price to pay if the talks fail .
George W. Bush and Tony Blair have lost the popularity they enjoyed before the Iraq war , and Blair , together with French President Jacques Chirac , will soon leave the political scene .
others seek to broaden the definition of &quot; exceptional circumstances &quot; to permit the deficit ceiling to be breached in any year with prolonged unsatisfactory GDP growth , not just -@@ 2 % .
one important question is whether we see happiness as the surplus of pleasure over pain experienced over a lifetime , or as the degree to which we are satisfied with our lives .
insurance companies have faced a slow and difficult process in weaning the public from these tendencies .
land conversion for gra@@ zing ( and construction ) , together with crop til@@ lage , has also caused soil erosion at 15 times its natural rate .
that is why , after years of being neglected as a viable option , it is time for the social-democratic project to return to the political fore .
impas@@ sive capital now ignores deceptive market signals , and the liquidation of untenable m@@ al-@@ investment percol@@ ates through the system as immutable time preferences prevail .
this cost will be modest relative to the size of their economies , and any successful climate-change agreement will require similar commitments .
the Internet , by contrast , evolved in a bottom-up way , managing to escape the telecommunication giants &quot; initial appeals for regulation .
thus , the companies and countries with access to global data flows will reap the largest gains .
their capital standards should be raised , just as regulators have appropriately forced banks to do .
it has now reached the agenda of some African governments and the African Union .
the Spanish government assumes that Catalan &apos;s parliament will not dare to declare independence unilaterally , because the move would receive no international recognition .
to declare , as the President of the European Commission did , that this is an internal Spanish problem in which the EU has no say is hypocrisy on stil@@ ts .
Catalonia is now almost evenly divided over the question , in a manner unseen since the Spanish Civil War .
a shakeup of Spain &apos;s political and constitutional status quo is long overdue , and the entire country could emerge stronger if the reforms enacted in response to the Catalonia crisis help unleash the energies of one of Europe &apos;s most diverse nations .
as for the second question , I suspect that China will stay the course on the BRI , especially given the growing concerns about trade elsewhere in the world .
most of them are old , some of them are un@@ well .
as Chairman of the United States Federal Reserve Board , he has gone further than any other central banker in recent times in attempting to stimulate the economy through monetary policy .
given the dubious benefits of still lower real interest rates , placing central-bank credibility at risk would be irresponsible .
for central bankers , it was comforting to believe that they had reduced inflation by controlling demand , and that their policies had many beneficial side effects for the economy .
yet Poland , like many of the other new democracies in our region , remains stuck in the past when it comes to the humane treatment of drug users .
but Gavi , the V@@ acc@@ ine Alliance , has worked with manufacturers to reduce prices in developing countries .
more broadly , African countries need to put their political and economic houses in order .
moreover , the negotiations will now be under the jurisdiction of Iran &apos;s presidential administration , which gives Rouhani greater room for maneuver .
ironically , the predictions became poorer when the sound was turned on .
such visible demonstrations of defiance in the face of violence strengthen ties between communities and can prevent the division that extremists try to generate .
America &apos;s democratic institutions did not stand in the way of such policies in the early twentieth century .
so today , instead of asking whether American institutions will survive the Trump presidency , we must ask how American institutions can be put in the service of wrongful ends .
the standard explanation is weak Chinese demand , with the oil-price collapse widely regarded as a port@@ ent of recession , either in China or for the entire global economy .
the responsibility extends beyond the organizations themselves .
the World Bank estimates that over a third of all children in Indonesia , for example , suffer from stunted growth , confronting them with the risk of lifetime effects on fitness and cognitive development .
in the 1970s , fear of environmental degradation and societal collapse drove some well-intentioned people to remain chil@@ dless .
while there will never be a substitute for safe , unimpeded humanitarian access , we need to explore every avenue to reach children in danger .
besides , the nomination of a woman with a Nor@@ th-@@ African ascent as minister of Justice made that clear from the start .
but we need this wall to tumble if we do not want to miss today &apos;s revolution , which is delivering societies based on knowledge , technology , and information .
China &apos;s leadership remains steadfastly committed to protecting the Party &apos;s interests , which it views as cot@@ er@@ minous with those of society .
and now that Brazil and Russia have put their recent recessions behind them , the BRICs will likely make a large contribution to nominal global GDP in 2018 .
if China proves itself willing to help shore up Afghan President Hamid Karzai &apos;s administration , it will not seek to gain any immediate advantage from the withdrawal of US forces .
we will have to deal with a different type of superpower .
at the same time , an expansive reform effort cannot be advanced by economic decisions alone .
the Belt and Road initiative promises to help countries overcome these constraints , by providing external funding for ports , roads , schools , hospitals , and power plants and grids .
building on heavy investments in public infrastructure , such as ports , airports , roads , rail , and telecommunications , the Internet is now expanding rapidly the range of choices available to Chinese consumers , while lowering costs and accelerating delivery .
already in 2015 , China &apos;s cross-border e-commerce amounted to an estimated ¥ 5.2 trillion , or 17.@@ 6 % of the country &apos;s total trade ; it may reach ¥ 8 trillion , or 23 % of total trade , by next year .
one possible explanation for the divergence between credit and GDP growth is that potential growth has already dropped to 7 % .
but it is not as if the West has proved definitively that its free-market approach works .
here , the US needs to recognize that global cooperation is not a zero-sum game , and that China &apos;s rise need not be viewed as a threat .
in the chart below , we show that a country &apos;s net-@@ foreign-asset position correlates strongly with its long-term orientation .
recent MGI research found that in a rap@@ id-@@ automation scenario , some 8@@ 2-@@ 10@@ 2 million Chinese workers would need to switch jobs .
but in July , Trump announced a new round of tariffs targeting an additional $ 200 billion worth of Chinese goods , representing about 15 % of total exports to the US .
while the US stock market has had a robust recovery , the real economy has remained in the doldrums .
I first caught a whiff of it back in the late 1990s , during the Asian financial crisis .
now that the fall has arrived , domestic deflation has become a real threat , particularly given slower domestic fiscal expansion .
the aim was not to tackle the problems they faced directly , but to induce new , more efficient activities that would help to turn debt into assets and maximize use of the economy &apos;s capacity .
this advances the objective of helping local businesses , particularly innovative small and medium-size firms , to grow and thrive .
and that does not even account for the many migrant workers who live under the radar in cities and are likely to earn even less than the poorest 5 % .
foreign investors were required to enter into joint ventures with domestic firms and to increase the use of local inputs .
the conventional wisdom among social scientists is that the demands of advanced economies and growing middle classes can be met only through greater political freedoms and competition .
officials initially underestimated these effects , resulting in this summer &apos;s unanticipated volatility .
to be sure , as the A@@ -market headed toward 5,000 , regulators finally realized that the risk of a sharp correction was rising , too .
indeed , although ministries , seeking to protect their own turf , undoubtedly impede one another on major issues , they have been collaborating wholeheartedly in China &apos;s effort to reshape the world economic order .
they must decide whether to continue trying to control the economy or to follow through on their promise to build a genuinely market-oriented system .
he did not set a specific income goal , but it is safe to say that he probably expected China to do better than it did : by World Bank standards , China at the turn of the century was a lower-middle-income country .
for example , IMF quota and governance reform , on which G-20 leaders agreed in 2010 , has yet to be implemented .
understandably , China &apos;s leadership wants to increase productivity and continue to move further up the value chain .
today &apos;s electricity is largely generated by burning coal and natural gas ; these thermal power plants need to be phased out and replaced by electricity generated by solar , wind , hydro , nuclear , and other non-carbon sources .
China &apos;s strong fiscal position today gives it a window of opportunity .
the phrase &quot; new normal &quot; is a clever bit of messaging by China &apos;s leaders , who must explain to the country &apos;s 1.4 billion citizens why the economy will no longer be growing by 10 % a year .
CM2025 has sometimes been portrayed as a return to old-school top-down mercantilist practices and import-@@ substitution policies . but that reading overlooks China &apos;s active experimentation with industrial and financial policies .
portraying them as a genuine threat to the world &apos;s democracies not only betrays the West &apos;s own insecurity , but also gives China more credit than it deserves .
like Trump , Chinese President Xi Jinping has reversed many of his predecessors &quot; policies , including some of the market-oriented reforms pushed through by Deng Xiaoping .
in the eyes of the Chinese public , government officials are venal , incompetent , and interested solely in getting lucrative appointments .
with a large reservoir of surplus savings and a budget deficit of less than 2 % of GDP , it has the wherewithal to fund such efforts .
but the structure of China &apos;s national balance sheet suggests that it still has plenty of room to mitigate the risks that escalating debt might bring .
the rest of the Chinese economy is dynamic , decentralized , and privately owned .
in the meantime , China faces another , equally daunting challenge : the United States &quot; growing determination to contain its growing influence .
in the West , government accountability is closely identified with democratic elections .
in a study of loan data from five Chinese banks , a team of researchers and I identified five factors that influence the emergence of non-performing SM@@ E and consumer loans .
some were fairly obvious : larger loans and higher leverage ratios contribute to higher rates of NPLs .
but Xi is not Mao , and he will not govern China as Mao did .
the final piece of the puzzle for China is realism .
these aging workers might now be saving as much as they possibly can , to build up a financial cushion for impending retirement .
if the government were truly becoming more responsive , why have we not seen similar responses to other disputes over the theft of farmland , compromised investors &quot; rights , or high-level corruption ?
since 80 % of HIV / AIDS patients reside in the countryside , greater access to health care in these areas has become a priority .
international orders emerge either by consensus or through force .

one might think that foreign investors would quake in terror at these terms and shy away from dollar-denominated assets .
with 3,000 villages destroyed and 1.5 million people already displaced in eastern Burma , a humanitarian disaster has been unfolding for some time now .
the pace of transformation is breathtaking .
so , China &apos;s &quot; socialism with Chinese characteristics &quot; is an economy where an increasing share of national income goes to the state .
today , however , China has decent infrastructure , impressive buildings , and an excessive industrial base .
it &apos;s not just the increase in the number of free@@ ways , billboards , and skyscrapers that dis@@ orient long-time visitors .
Google is now crying foul over &quot; a highly sophisticated and targeted attack on our corporate infrastructure originating from China . &quot;
its key feature is to shift official policy from maximizing GDP growth toward raising consumption and average workers &quot; standard of living .
true , China has made the kind of economic advances in three decades that required 100 years in Western countries .
legal activism in China is not unprecedented .
that may require innovative approaches , quite different from intellectual property regimes based on privatization and monopolization of knowledge , with the high prices and restricted benefits that follow .
until now , its success was based on positive competition between local governments and different ministries , bench@@ marked according to performance indicators such as GDP and fiscal revenues .
their success inevitably requires directly confronting their evident moral failures .
indeed , almost simultaneously with the PLA incursion , scholars at an official Chinese think tank questioned Japanese sovereignty over Okinawa .
while America says that it cannot afford to do anything about it , China &apos;s senior officials have acted more responsibly .
even if it is , GDP-@@ obsessed and debt-ridden local governments are likely to strive to achieve the highest possible growth rates for themselves , while paying lip service to Wen &apos;s call for a slowdown .
even traditional private companies like Huawei and M@@ idea have done much better , adjusting to shifting consumer demand and changing factor costs by retooling as quickly as possible , acquiring , for example , robot technology and product designs from the West .
how , then , can China be brought on board ?
China is militarily self-sufficient and needs military cooperation under the SC@@ O framework only in order to free its hands if any conflict should arise that affects its interests .
and better environmental regulation is crucial .
of course , the language that he used to sell his scheme to the Chinese was very different from the words his father used to present his plans to Hitler .
it is not a good sign that the high costs in many Chinese provinces have been weighing down overall growth .
supply-side structural reform is intended to address these problems , producing a more sustainable , inclusive , open , and efficient economy .
at the same time , the demonstrations represent China &apos;s experience of the world as an unequal place where the weak are inevitably bullied , exploited , and humiliated .
reduction in US business services would cost another 8@@ 5,000 jobs .
so far , economists have focused largely on the impending shifts in China &apos;s demographic structure .
of course , tariffs are far from the only way to create obstacles to trade .
though America currently remains intent on resurrecting a tired growth model , there is good reason to hope that it , too , will eventually rebalance .
the 2008 global financial crisis , coupled with the disappointing recovery in the advanced economies that followed , injected a new urgency into China &apos;s efforts to shift its growth model from one based on investment and external demand to one underpinned by domestic consumption .
whether that will be enough to avoid disorderly outcomes , however , is not totally assured .
and the entire global financial spas@@ m has been largely blamed on a single culprit : China .
but , faced with South Korea &apos;s shining democracy and booming economy , the Chinese model is irrelevant to the North : following it would mean acknowledging the South &apos;s supremacy on the Korean Peninsula , and thus an instant loss of legitimacy .
still , that identity has been fractured ; I hope not beyond repair .
indeed , the factory model implies significant land-use change and deforestation , beginning with the production of feed .
central banks should return to more conventional monetary policies only when robust growth is firmly rooted .
the Chinese believed that the entire purpose was to confront and contain their country &apos;s geopolitical rise .
but have we taken the emphasis on citation too far ?
indeed , the gains from economic growth are increasingly going to the very highest earners .
as a result , breaking up Citigroup is under serious consideration as a potential campaign theme .
the prevailing view is that the downward trend largely reflects a fall in equilibrium or &quot; natural &quot; interest rates , driven by changes in saving and investment fundamentals .
if that extra loss pushes a systemically vital Citi@@ bank over the precipice , the clearinghouse has not reduced systemic risk as advertised .
in fact , meeting higher electricity demand and achieving national targets for production of biofuels and other alternative fuels would require a more than twofold increase in global water use for energy production over the next quarter-century .
and yet , as the planet heats up and sea levels rise , the pattern of cyclones in the Bay of Bengal and elsewhere will change .
the moral and economic imperatives to act on climate change could not be stronger .
such strategies should focus on ar@@ able-@@ land management and water conservation , among other areas .
China , too , is unlikely to agree to &quot; caps &quot; on emissions of any kind , given the relatively low standard of living of most Chinese .
over time , a failure to reduce greenhouse gas emissions would lead to additional climate change , which in turn would increase the severity of poverty , the scale of internal displacement and migration , the scarcity of water , the prevalence of disease , and the number and intensity of storms .
bio@@ fuel subsidies contributed to rising food prices , and their swift growth was reined in only when models showed that up to another 135 million people could starve by 2020 .
imagine if the director of the CIA published a new assessment of Iran , saying &quot; I hope this report will shock people , governments into taking more serious action . &quot;
maritime cooperation was a focus of attention at both the AR@@ F ministerial meeting and at the EA@@ S , not least because China &apos;s activities in the South and East China Seas have generated fresh uncertainty in the region .

peace comes at a cost , and people often disagree about who should foot the bill .
as technology reduces the cost of transportation and communications to near the vanishing point , achieving this equ@@ alization is increasingly feasible .
that explains how so many commodity prices can be down in terms of dollars and up in terms of other currencies .
of course , that was no ordinary downturn .
Trump &apos;s protectionism also has a geopolitical root .
first , the EU must take in a substantial number of refugees directly from front-line countries in a secure and orderly manner .
any st@@ roll along a crowded Istanbul street will show covered and uncovered women effor@@ tlessly -- almost naturally -- mixing .
more precisely , Alesina argued that while bleeding on its own would worsen the patient &apos;s condition , its beneficial impact on expectations would more than offset its debilitating effects .
on the demand side , consumers expect a lot more from the products and services they use .
this is just one example of how icddr , b has helped alleviate human suffering in times of crisis .
&quot; the failure to fit the system makes people attack that system , &quot; he said , &quot; so it is never wise to bomb nations to freedom . &quot;
today &apos;s world leaders appear to lack the statesmanship , the breadth of vision , and the generosity of spirit of those who created the post-1945 world order .
Singapore is leading the way in another area as well : production and distribution of potable recycled water .
a transaction involving potatoes happens at one point in time only : the buyer parts with her money , the seller parts with his tu@@ bers , and that is it .
a financial transaction , by contrast , happens over time : the borrower gets the money today and promises to repay in a month , year , or decade .
along the way , scientists get paid for finding just the right mix of salt , sugar , and chemicals to make the latest instant food maxim@@ ally addictive ; advertisers get paid for peddling it ; and , in the end , the health-care industry makes a fortune treating the disease that inevitably results .
smaller-@@ scale corruption is bad , but systemic corruption of political processes can have even greater costs .
though campaign contributions do not guarantee victory , they give the economic elite greater access to legislators , regulators , and other public officials , enabling them to shape the political debate in favor of their interests .
research and innovation , or engagement with local entrepreneurs and inventors , is , unfortunately , never on the agenda .
there is mounting evidence that sustainable solutions must have local support and local partners .
so the pre-war CDR that the two Lancet studies yield seems too low .
but we can expect that the market for long-term GDP-linked bonds from countries like Argentina , where the future of the economy is uncertain , would be volatile , as investors adjust their expectations of future GDP growth up and down in response to new information .
droughts afflicted around 60 % of US counties , including the bread@@ basket states of the Midwest and the Great Pla@@ ins .
with the government now seeking to negotiate even looser membership terms , Britain will end up more estranged from the EU even if it remains a member .
the Kirchners lifted Argentina out of the deep crisis of 2001 , presiding over GDP growth rates similar to those of China .
some of those actions will have to be disruptive , because the momentum of organizations can carry them beyond their usefulness .
we formed the San@@ gh@@ a Coalition when we saw that the country &apos;s monks were united .
there is either too much money , which causes inflation , or too little , which leads to depression .

the resulting private-sector imbalances culminated in banking problems that were eventually transferred to sovereigns .
voters are feeling the pain of economic isolation , made worse by the global downturn .
the many other victims of ultra-low interest rates should be all too apparent .
but , while abolishing energy subsidies is absolutely essential to balance the budget and put the economy on a sound footing , these steps also risk hitting eastern Ukraine , which contains a substantial Rus@@ soph@@ one minority , particularly hard .
compensation would take the form of retraining programs for personnel , and maybe refinancing of loans taken to finance specialized machinery .
as long as the military remains the ultimate political arbiter , these groups focus their strategies on the military rather than one another .

Homo economicus , the rationally acting ego@@ ist who popul@@ ates economists &quot; models , has recently attracted criticism as well , because all too often he does not represent the real behavior of individuals .
L@@ evity aside , the answer reveals the po@@ mp@@ ousness and vacu@@ ity of each and every economic theory .
economic historians like Ken Pom@@ er@@ an@@ z rightly point out that before the Industrial Revolution , differences in median standards of living across the high civilizations of Eurasia were relatively small .
perhaps a maxim@@ ally extended life expectancy is of higher value to you than living in a society where doctors do not leave cur@@ able patients to die if they cannot pay for the required treatment out of their own pockets .
today , in areas most affected by the fighting , it has dropped to below 30 % .
why , then , nearly two decades after the framework was signed , is this commitment to rebuilding routinely ignored ?
this might mean investing in cutting-edge businesses like Uber , as the Japanese-@@ Korean industri@@ alist Mas@@ a@@ yo@@ shi Son has done .
such cooperation has already begun .
this was followed by approval of the law , a request for its revision , and a surprise official meeting with the leader of Hamas .
in addition , the Egyptian military gave a $ 1 billion loan to the government , and another $ 1 billion was received through grants from Saudi Arabia and Qatar , bringing the loss of reserves since December 2010 closer to $ 22 billion .
much depends on Egypt , which is best placed to broker an agreement .
the struggle for Egypt thus continues .
instead , they engaged with identity issues and security challenges in ways that reflect their diverging political paths .
that is as true for soccer as it is for many other pursuits , from business processes to technology .
renewed peace negotiations in Geneva next year can succeed only if Assad comes to the table substantially weaker , which probably will not happen .
as a result , the cosmo@@ logical term that has been &quot; reinstated &quot; to account for the new observations is not quite the one that Einstein proposed and re@@ tracted .
likewise , the mid-twentieth century &quot; B@@ oh@@ r-@@ Einstein debate &quot; about quantum theory is often mis@@ interpreted as a personal clash between wizards .
the near-universal availability of information makes it much easier than it was in earlier times for the voluntary non-governmental organizations that form civil society to emerge .
making health services more widely available is a starting point .
the fourth priority is to leverage the private sector .
the issues are detailed and technical , and the financial lobby has deployed a small army of highly paid experts on a mission of delay , dilu@@ tion , and diversion .
one may or may not agree with K@@ ouch@@ ner &apos;s policies , but his motives are surely impeccable .
for example , the new labor-@@ displacing technologies could make feasible activities for which there had been insufficient skilled labor .
for that , developing countries will need to deploy new technologies relatively efficiently , taking into account the role of labor-market skills and regulations .
China &apos;s phenomenal rate of expansion has slowed to below 7 % .
simply put , we must complete the global inventory of species .
five hundred thousand years of experience in hunting and gathering , coupled with cheaper and faster molecular analysis , performed by faster and cheaper computers makes this task economically feasible .
in addition , more sophisticated and differentiated export products tend to respond more to exchange-rate fluctuations .
during the second half of last year , the 15 largest emerging-market economies experienced the biggest capital outflows since the 2008 global financial crisis .
capital inflows recovered somewhat , and most emerging-market economies weathered the financial distress in their capital markets .
so it is imperative that strong safeguards are put in place to protect minorities , particularly the Serbs .
President A@@ si@@ f Ali Zardari went even further , saying that he did not care about the &quot; collateral damage . &quot;
to get peace in Afghanistan , indeed all of South Asia , the US needs to give peace a chance !
the outcome will underpin their lending over the next 4-@@ 6 years , and send a strong political and financial signal about worldwide commitment to addressing climate change .
it is true that nuclear weapons cannot be un@@ invented , but that does not mean that nuclear disarmament is an impossible dream .
for many , fear of reputational or even physical harm has created a culture of shame that discourages a strong , dignified response .
another colleague did not think her experience of digital violence would be taken seriously , because it had not happened in the &quot; real world . &quot;
first and foremost , the war in Syria is a proxy war , involving mainly the United States , Russia , Saudi Arabia , Turkey , and Iran .
ending the N@@ ever-@@ En@@ ding War on Drugs
in fact , with member states &quot; domestic politics playing a more important role than the European Council in driving whatever EU policy momentum exists , even an intergovernmental EU may be too much to hope for .
now it is time for a fresh and bold approach toward all contending political forces in the Muslim world .
we face an urgent need to define a safety zone that prevents us from pushing our planet out of the unusually benevolent Ho@@ loc@@ ene state .
instead , Erdoğan emphasized to his Iranian counterparts the international community &apos;s resolve to bring transparency to Iran &apos;s nuclear program , and insisted on the importance of concrete progress in the next round of the nuclear talks .
if the party is able to secure more than 45 % of the national vote , the qu@@ ir@@ ks in Turkey &apos;s electoral law will give it more than 330 representatives in the country &apos;s 5@@ 50-@@ seat legislature .
any semblance of the rule of law and due process has disappeared .
for months , he told himself and others that first &quot; Japan must have another brilliant military gain &quot; over the US , so that it would have a modicum of diplomatic clout in negotiating a postwar settlement .
just when one is lulled into thinking that something other than oil is at the root of current US and UK action in Iraq , reality pulls us back .
the problem is broader than Watsi .
for example , ten years ago I took over a moribund event about anti-@@ spyware tools .
website startups may even want to check their users &quot; profiles on the Angel L@@ ist database of ange@@ l investors , viewing them as a potential source of financing .
even though America &apos;s financial markets nearly collapsed , its public-debt levels rose sharply , and the Federal Reserve was forced to undertake massive monetary expansion to support the economy , the dollar strengthened relative to most other currencies .
that may sound disingenuous to some , but Hong Kong &apos;s officials share a common mission to maintain the stability and prosperity of our city .
European democrats with a civilized view of governance , meanwhile , are punished .
and a banking union , once completed , should contain the risk of financial crisis and contagion .
although some countries have been allowed to breach the deficit cap during challenging times , Italy is almost never afforded much accommodation , owing to its high debt levels .
but the plan &apos;s limited scope undermines this impression .
in relative terms , Greece received most of Europe &apos;s bailout money and showed the largest increase in unemployment .
vital European and transatlantic interests are at stake .
that likely split is highly unfortunate , to the extent that it worsens the real problem the European Commission identified .
the question was whether the children were victims of discrimination owing to their national minority status .
for this reason , Europeans have often looked toward the model of the United States .
but over the past 20 years , support for agricultural development has been declining .
the Global Strategy defines clear objectives , considers the mistakes of the past , and is deeply anchored in the EU &apos;s present-day reality .
one consequence of a document like the Global Strategy is the creation of a common discourse .
some , including Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov , claim that the conflicts generating these refugees rage only in Arab countries that are being bombed by the West .
immigrants from Algeria , Bangladesh , Pakistan , or Turkey will , in the course of a generation or two , become European in outlook and politics .
but it is not a strong recovery ; at best , the gap between where the economy would have been and where it is today is not widening .
defeating populism will require leaders to acknowledge the people left behind as a result of globalization , but also to dispel the myth that there is a quick fix , or that globalization can simply be reversed .
and , indeed , there are assor@@ ted examples of the EU assuming something of an executive position ; notably , the EU is expected to play a leading role in implementing its recent deal with Turkey to resolve the refugee crisis .
of more than 60,000 take@@ -@@ charge requests lodged by German authorities in 2017 under the Dublin Regulation , fewer than 15 % were actually implemented , resulting in just 7,@@ 100 transfers to other member states .
perhaps these words sound exaggerated to cynical ears .
but that didn &apos;t stop him from tackling a controversial subject .
but few confront Europe &apos;s twin obstacles of anemic productivity growth and demographic decline .
rather , they should pursue policies that support investment , encourage innovation , and promote the development of skills .
it aligns with the logic of central-bank independence : unelected policymakers are committed to a straightforward set of rules , such as targeting a particular inflation rate , against which they can be held accountable .
the second fault line appeared alongside the refugee crisis .
all of this is well and good , but it will amount to nothing if EU leaders do not &quot; join up , &quot; as Mogherini puts it , to ensure that the strategy fulfills its potential .
Greece &apos;s continuing insolvency reflects the deep disagreements within the Franco-German axis concerning eurozone redesign .
but EU member governments &quot; behavior during the past few months raises grave doubts about whether they see things this way .
most striking is European backwardness in high-tech development and innovation .
the third important difference is that all US states are required by their constitutions to balance their annual operating budgets .
a sense of fair play also matters within the Union .
instead , the EU made a few bureaucratic tweaks to its asylum system and consumed itself with debates about non-@@ issues , such as migrant &quot; welfare che@@ ats . &quot;
yet , for recipient countries , immigration remains a contentious topic , with governments struggling to settle on policies that will enable their economies to reap the benefits and avoid incurring excessive costs .
Africa &apos;s long-term development will of course require greater political stability and peace ; in the meantime , however , there are steps that Europe can take to help spur growth .
we must act because we can act .
it is widely assumed that economic migrants , from inside or outside the EU , are mainly poor people out to live off the tax money of the relatively rich .
looking ahead , Europe &apos;s welfare states will need to be reformed to address current realities .
too many Europeans are collecting too many benefits , but so far governments have mostly duc@@ ked the issue , taking on massive debt in order to postpone the reckoning .
when it is safe to return home , those who have not obtained permanent residency or citizenship should do so .
there is plenty of blame to go around .
but can Europe remain a model if it is no longer a serious geopolitical actor ?
in Europe , we by and large failed to heed the warning signals of America &apos;s sub-prime mortgage crisis when it erupted in the late summer of 2007 , and thus were unprepared when the next phase of the crisis engulfed European banks , too .
the Union &apos;s founding story is not their story , but the story of their parents or grandparents .
in the end , the agreement that will emerge later this year will do little , if anything , to change economic conditions in Europe .
yet , the European Commission still encourages young Europeans to learn as many different languages as possible .
it is also an occasion for celebrating the effectiveness of democracy , and the power of an ethical idea .
Europe needs such countries on its border .
the banks need real stress tests , not the official confidence game carried out earlier this year .
not only does a higher percentage of American adults work , but they also work more hours per week and more weeks per year .
unfortunately not : progress resulted almost exclusively from the pressure of the much-@@ malig@@ ned financial markets .
as a share of total government spending , defense expenditure has fallen from 7.@@ 8 % in 1998 to 6.1 % in 2006 .
owing to the ongoing operations in Iraq and Afghanistan , any future British government will inherit a military that is overstretched , under@@ manned , and working with wor@@ n-out equipment .
next , the Commission will build on our current proposals for deposit-@@ guarantee schemes and bank resolution mechanisms to move toward a single resolution fund and a single resolution authority .
of course , these fears are accompanied by the hope that structural reforms and monetary expansion work in harmony , boosting employment and output without raising inflation by much .
it is one thing to back the &quot; European project &quot; when the idea is to bind Germany so tightly to France that never again will anybody think it worthwhile to wage a war over what language is spoken in Al@@ sac@@ e-@@ Lor@@ ra@@ ine .
but will the Union &apos;s new Constitutional Treaty put an end to this pattern of evolutionary constitution building ?
opening up markets and applying European rules properly produces savings for governments and delivers better value for taxpayers &quot; money .
this is not a unique situation .
consequently , economic progress has not kept pace with the accumulation of oil revenues .
none of Europe &apos;s financial problems would look remotely as challenging today if doubts about the eurozone &apos;s future had been dispelled two years ago , and the reputational and financial costs would have been dramatically less than they have been in the past 30 months .
whereas young Europeans look for jobs and entrepreneurial opportunities in America , young Americans go to Europe as tourists .
such a threat should not be taken lightly .
indeed , we used to quote Ortega y G@@ asset : &quot; if Spain is the problem , Europe is the solution . &quot;
yet they also point to exceptional win@@ dows in time when it is possible for societies to shift away from their established paths .
by that point , Ukraine &apos;s spring@@ time of freedom had already deteriorated into a very visible development standstill , owing to a mixture of incompetence and corruption that cri@@ ed out for change .
indeed , it took a motivated Germany four to five years to do it .
the result is an impression of Europe as a marketplace .
they can enroll in government-funded , indu@@ str@@ y-@@ organized training schemes .
because the premiums are intimately interconnected with the banks &quot; capital deficiencies , half a solution is not good enough .
from the perspective of the European Union , the latest US security bailout raises the possibility that after more than two decades of growing prominence , Europe will lose its agenda-setting power .
terrorism has reemerged as an important threat .
after all , Germany has experienced a much larger influx of foreigners than Britain or the US .
it is incumbent upon those of us who wish to improve Europe &apos;s efficiency , and lessen its gross injustices , to work toward re-@@ politici@@ zing the eurozone as a first step toward democratizing it .
but a more robust and sustained recovery still faces many challenges .
taking it would help to heal Europe &apos;s wounds and clear the ground for the debate that the European Union needs about the kind of political union that Europeans deserve .
nonetheless , nominal rates do matter .
third , a burgeoning migration crisis is raising questions about European values and identity .
whenever a firm chooses to evade , it becomes increasingly difficult to find a vend@@ or willing to engage in legal transactions .
Woodrow Wilson , asking for a declaration of war against Germany , said , &quot; We have no quarrel with the German people .
their deaths are easier to stomach , and to justify , so long as air@@ men and soldiers , and the public watching at home , believe the violence was at least directed against evil incarnate .
beyond undermining the gene-@@ centered theories of evolution that have dominated public consciousness for several decades , these developments call for new philosophical frameworks .
more neutral observers - and indeed , the daily news bul@@ let@@ ins about bombings and hostage taking and &quot; insurgents &quot; - cast doubt on that prospect .
the respite from the horrendous spate of suicide bombings since the new government assumed power is similarly heartening .
human rights groups suggested the charge was invented , because the police had dropped the case for lack of evidence when it was first investigated 12 years ago , and neither witnesses nor new evidence were produced in court .
the younger brother , Ch@@ ime Nam@@ g@@ yal , 38 , who is disabled , has been hospitalized since June 11 for serious injuries received wh@@ il@@ st in custody .
crucially , even as China &apos;s specific goals have shifted , its policymakers have adhered to the experimental approach that has served the country so well thus far .
with an administration full of Goldman Sachs alumni , and an agenda that promises tax cuts for the super-rich while privatizing Medicare and education , Trump is bound to disappoint the white working class that won him the White House .
while Hansen &apos;s warnings came when climate science was in its infancy , scientists today have connected the d@@ ots among CO2 emissions , climate change , and severe weather .
for example , between 1955 and 1973 , West Germany admitted 14 million &quot; guest workers , &quot; largely from Turkey .
the number of people proclaiming their faith worldwide is growing .
I was interviewed for about an hour , with my answers to be included in an episode centered on a panel discussion held in the studio .
as long as only its purveyors have the data we need to understand it , the responses we craft will remain inadequate .
this may relieve some pressure , but it only shifts the problem from the ECB bailout fund to the community of states .
it is time to face the fact that Europe &apos;s peripheral countries have to shrink their nominal GDP to regain competitiveness . the only question is whether they will take the euro down as well .
&quot; the practice of cal@@ m@@ ness , of im@@ mobility , of certainty and security , suddenly breaks down , &quot; Keynes wrote . &quot; new fears and hopes will , without warning , take charge of human conduct . &quot;
one of the most exciting innovations to help farmers is satellite technology .
still , a better seed or a new technology can &apos;t transform the lives of farming families until it &apos;s in their hands .
the C@@ ourage to Nor@@ mali@@ ze Monetary Policy
the banks , it would be fair to say , do not wholly accept regulators &quot; arguments about that , but they have bit@@ ten their tongues and paid up .
the discussion quickly turned to the difficulty of measuring inflation accurately and the need to build in a &quot; safety cushion &quot; to avoid deflation .
Greenspan summarized the consensus : ... &quot; we have now all agreed on 2 % ... &quot;
unfortunately , policy backsliding is jeopardizing this historic &quot; graduation &quot; from pro-@@ cyclic@@ ality .
however , other central banks , particularly in economies where the output gap is larger than in the United States , will not be keen to follow the Fed &apos;s lead .
when objections were raised to Cuba being put on the drafting committee , Harry D@@ ex@@ ter White , the American representative , remarked that Cuba &apos;s function was to provide ci@@ g@@ ars .
companies , not surprisingly , say that their responsibility extends only so far .
diseases like cholera and tuberculosis were rife , and there was no way to treat them .
gene@@ ticists then performed genetic finger@@ printing on the yellow beans , and concluded that Pro@@ c@@ tor &apos;s E@@ no@@ la bean was identical to the Mexican beans covered by the Trust Agreement .
the fight against corruption mobilizes all of us because we want to do away with evil and injustice .
similarly , Facebook closed accounts of individuals and organizations that were using the platform to document violence against Muslim Rohingya in Myanmar , a crisis that the United Nations has called a &quot; textbook example of ethnic cleansing . &quot;
the Bush administration now seems to realize this .
it would be a mistake to believe that the deaths of thousands of civilians , along with arbitrary imprisonment and torture , do not contribute to the spread of terror in Iraq .
if we persevere on our current course , the situation will continue to deteriorate .
what about secular stagnation theory ?
already , the task force has done much to encourage financial institutions and companies to understand , assess , and disclose the extent of the climate risks they face .
EU finance ministers have also just agreed to begin requiring banks to disclose environmental , social , and governance ( ESG ) risks within three years .
and financial-sector bailouts will be intolerable in countries with resurgent populist movements and near-@@ insolvent governments .
although M-Pesa has been operating for less than a decade in a much lower-income market , it had nearly 17 million active users conducting more than $ 50 billion in cashless transactions last year .
only then will the good news about financial inclusion become great .
US President Donald Trump &apos;s more radical , populist policies have been partly contained .
these late movers were also likely to have been sophisticated electronic or institutional traders ; some were probably using arbit@@ ra@@ ge-@@ based strategies that relied on the futures market for a calculation of the fair price .
that framework must also support the private sector and investors in their effort to combine profit maximization with the pursuit of long-term economic , social , and environmental objectives .
the imposition of higher capital requirements on riskier investments has pushed financial institutions into holding government debt , which in turn means that they have less money available to lend for productive investment .
as extreme weather events continue to multiply , large-scale destruction , migration , and conflict will become endemic .
I confess that I am rather afraid of sp@@ id@@ ers , but even an ar@@ ach@@ no@@ pho@@ be like me found little reason to be worried .
the emergence of in@@ extingu@@ ishable debt replic@@ ates other troubling aspects of contemporary life .
the legacy of the past continually resur@@ faces to constrain action in the present .
yet the budget resources available for such multilateral cooperation are a pittance .
several sources of financing for adaptation and mitigation efforts in developing countries could be made operational relatively quickly .
by leveraging roughly $ 2 billion in donor guarantees , the finance facility aims to make $ 10 billion in grant and concessional funding available to countries that need it most .
many of them will also be desirable : longer , healthier , and higher quality lives as we learn more about the details of human biology .
imagine , for example , that Germany borrows at a 1 % fixed real interest rate with a ten-year maturity and invests the proceeds in repairing domestic transport infrastructure .
a fundamental requirement of this approach is an open mind , unconstrained by the subject &apos;s idiosyncratic dogma .
Hy@@ po@@ the@@ tically , if the US adopted Denmark &apos;s universal free education policy , but kept its tax-@@ to-GDP ratio unchanged , its fiscal deficit would exceed 6 % of GDP .
but instead of focusing on currency wars , the leaders of the major developed economies should be discussing fiscal policy , which under current conditions would be a more powerful tool than monetary policy for boosting economic activity .
and all of these issues are inter-connected .
moreover , while Kemal Atat@@ urk restored Turkish national pride by creating the secular Turkish republic , his legacy is mixed , for it includes both Turkey &apos;s strong attraction to the West and a militarization of public life .
politicians may use it to deflect attention from the slow pace of national energy policy reform .
governments , too , must be actively engaged in how innovations are introduced to society .
yet not only is such a demand naïve , with the Bush team battling for re-election , it is not at all certain that most of America &apos;s European allies would heed a US call for solidarity if one were issued .
so action is needed on all three fronts .
we remember having seen the left govern without drama .
by 1995 , relative poverty was increasing sharply for young adults , while the opposite trend occurred among the elderly .
whatever the reason for the right &apos;s decline , Macron has benefited substantially from it , as well as from the rifts afflicting the left .
with the Q@@ PC , the entire process of assessing the constitu@@ tionality of legislation has gained greater acceptance in French legal practice .
it is no longer the privilege of the political class : testing a law for its constitu@@ tionality has become a right of all citizens .
the Fre@@ e-@@ Market Case Against Tax Competition
still , market liberals would argue that corporate taxes &quot; distort &quot; behavior and hamper wealth creation .
he recommended its replacement by a statutory Press Com@@ pla@@ ints Tribunal .
thus , in many French schools , teachers avoid mentioning religion whenever possible .
in Austria , the historian David Irving was arrested recently because he has denied that the Holocaust happened .
how many of the students now approved of the change ?
again , &quot; secretaries and policy makers , &quot; not &quot; policy makers and secretaries , &quot; are coming over for film night .
these Palestinians are Middle Israel &apos;s natural allies .
such runs were the ruin of AIG , Bear Stearns , and others during the financial crisis .
instead , we survived the financial tsunami of 2008 , only to rebuild in the same place , on the main financial fa@@ ul@@ t-@@ lines , using the same flawed design .
but educating those scientists and potential entrepreneurs is an uphill battle .
indeed , economists supported the global movement toward central-bank independence precisely because it seemed that central bankers would be less inclined to try to stimulate the economy for short-term gain .
today , there are growing concerns about third parties accessing and manipulating Facebook user data ; and before that , there was a raging debate about whether the government should be able to unlock devices belonging to suspects of terrorism or other crimes .
although the monetary an@@ es@@ thetics administered by the ECB have reduced market tensions , nervousness has reemerged in the run-up to the Italian constitutional referendum on December 4 .
finally , the governance of the eurozone remains excessively cumbersome and technocratic .
for starters , discussion of the eurozone &apos;s future should not be framed as necessarily leading to further integration .
to overcome the second obstacle , the discussion should not start by addressing the legacy problems .
but whatever their motive , their decision has resonated widely .
in Germany , it was imbued with Im@@ manuel Kant &apos;s vision of &quot; perpetual peace , &quot; grounded in the &quot; categorical imperative &quot; to act according to maxim@@ s that can be made into a universal law , rather than according to personal wh@@ ims and narrow self-interest .
for this reason , the future of global cooperation was at stake in Hamburg .
these include independent groups like Refugees International ( I@@ R ) and Mé@@ dec@@ ins S@@ ans Fron@@ ti@@ è@@ res ( MSF ) .
in addition , governments and regulators can take concrete steps to stimulate private-sector investment in cleaner forms of energy .
if these fundamental institutions were right , then landlords , merchants , and manufacturers would invest and improve .
third , while rising powers &quot; ambition for more space and influence is a given , it is not remotely inevitable that this quest must take a military form .
if the West strays from that primary goal , the enterprise is likely to end in tears , like so many others in the Middle East .
sustained support for institutions like the Global Fund and Gavi , for the empowerment of women and girls , and for innovation is crucial to accelerating progress for the world &apos;s poorest people .
too often , when an organization does not correct a mis@@ statement , it is taken as agreement .
to Sal@@ tman , investing time and money to think about the differences between men &apos;s and women &apos;s movement in ISIS wasn &apos;t &quot; about gender equality .
and , given the societal and economic biases against women in most countries , these early life circumstances place girls at an even more severe disadvantage .
we call on all women and men to join us in making their voices heard loudly and in seizing this opportunity for a just and equitable future for all .
in places where such tax revenues may not be sufficient , private investment can be attracted .
and whereas fiscal transfers help counter inequality and fight poverty , they do little to repair the social fabric .
China &apos;s rulers , for their part , are betting that they can survive a sharp economic slowdown and that the country will out@@ grow the US , changing the balance of power in Asia .
the Fund &apos;s annual budget is only € 12 million ( $ 1@@ 6.3 million ) , of which my foundations cover nearly half , and we find it difficult to secure additional funds .
future crises will be political in origin .
the only sure way of doing that is by purchasing additional imports , spending on which will inevitably increase .
if the algorithm doesn &apos;t do the job of silencing less privileged voices , online trolls often step in , directing hateful and threatening speech at whomever they choose .
political Europe was stillborn at the moment of greatest potential .
Germany &apos;s competitive advantage has less to do with chic@@ an@@ ery than with how its firms are structured and the culture in which they operate .
West Germany was a reliable player in NATO &apos;s Cold War system of burden sharing , and the Bunde@@ swe@@ h@@ r in the 1980s was a capable force .
some now fear that the TTIP is just another trick , intended to take advantage of Germany &apos;s economic strength and generosity .
the second unknown concerns what , exactly , separates the major parties in this contest .
a second fallacy is the belief that politicians and central banks can actually set exchange rates .
successful reform requires changing people &apos;s mindset and habitu@@ ating them to self-regulation .
predictability regarding the future course of regulation would unlock projects held back by uncertainty .
against this backdrop , UN member governments should acknowledge the gap between the ideals they espoused last year and the harsh realities many migrants and refugees continue to face today .
high oil prices will dampen global growth in the remainder of 2004 and into 2005 .
this is a bargain that the Iranians themselves have repeatedly hinted at .
furthermore , North Korea unilaterally canceled the re@@ union of separated families only a few days before the agreed date , breaking the hearts of those who had long been eagerly awaiting it .
we will stick to these fundamental principles and set the following priorities for future North Korea policies .
of course , considering the nature of inter-Korean relations , not all matters can be disclosed in full detail .
at least her fate looks to be better than that of Ghosn , who was arrested in Tokyo when he landed there in a private jet , and now faces accusations that he mis@@ appropriated company funds and paid himself millions of dollars in hidden compensation .
bit by bit , the idea that the group represents a coherent voice in world affairs will be quietly buried .
it is refreshing to encounter this acknowled@@ gment that government might sometimes be the problem .
at the time , foreign assistance was about 0.5 % of rich-country income .
this is d@@ enting confidence and holding back spending , investment , and job creation .
that &apos;s why requirements to establish local subsidiaries , with local capital , have been adopted .
if Europe truly wants to lead the fight against climate change , it should bring the issue of a harmonized carbon-@@ pricing system to the negotiating table in Paris .
indeed , the disaster-@@ risk reduction conference in Sendai is the first in a series of major international gatherings this year .
for example , what would it have cost to build the clinical and laboratory infrastructure and provide the training needed to identify and prevent the recent Ebola outbreak in West Africa ?
despite the European Central Bank &apos;s monetary accommodation , a sharp depreciation of the euro , and negative short-term interest rates , the European economy remains in the doldrums .
with the exception of the US , recent growth estimates have fallen short of previous projections , and some economies have even slowed .
the analytical foundations of many of these &quot; improvements &quot; appear shaky , and the challenges of implementing the new regulatory regime have proven formidable .
at this point , even &quot; efficient &quot; financial markets would struggle to adapt to normalization .
when opinion-makers in Western democracies promote the free international movement of capital , one could say that they are advancing the cause of global equality by raising the wages of workers in developing countries .
the finance industry , too , has suffered its own near &quot; supply chain &quot; meltdown in recent times .
across the full sample , 80 % of board chairs and 69 % of chief executives are male .
CE@@ P@@ I aims to change this .
this is an impossible target .
interconnected computers provide rich hunting grounds for cyber@@ criminals .
a pandemic , flood , or cyber attack in the City of London or Wall Street could send the entire world into a financial tailspin .
for example , migration can put wage pressure on lower-skill workers in destination countries .
exposing local industries to international competition spurs efficiency and innovation , but the resulting creative destruction exac@@ ts a substantial toll on families and communities .
while impressive and wholly welcome , poverty reduction has not come without a cost .
now , globalization &apos;s opponents in the emerging markets and developing countries have been joined by tens of millions in the advanced countries .
then the US established permanent normal trade relations with China and refused to brand its government a currency manipulator .
what this alternative will be , however , remains largely unknowable .
by creating a c@@ ordon san@@ it@@ aire of wealthy countries from Western Europe to Northeast Asia , the US hoped to contain the spread of communism at the start of the Cold War .
from recent research , we have learned a number of interesting things about how the evolution of economic structure affects employment .
nobody knows how long the current pause will last .
this seems to be why we focus on feel-good approaches like the Kyoto Protocol , whose fundamental problem has always been that it is simultaneously impossibly ambitious , environmentally inconsequential , and inordin@@ ately expensive .
this is akin to a me@@ teor@@ ologist predicting from his models that it will be sunny all day , instead of looking out the window to see whether rain is falling .
true , gold does not pay interest , and there are costs associated with storage .
prosperity became the main weapon that ensured the West &apos;s victory over Soviet communism .
government deficits incurred on current spending for services or transfers are bad , because they produce no revenue and add to the national debt .
with a soft economy , a badly compromised financial system , and serious concerns about rising inflation , the long-term dollar trend is downward , however the current crisis ends .
one would prefer to see Mexico &apos;s presidential candidates offer platforms with ideas and proposals that respond to the challenges facing the country , but this substance deficit occurs everywhere now , almost all the time .
Wei@@ sel claimed not to understand , so I explained : a majority of congressional Democrats supported the principle that the United States should sign trade agreements only with countries that are democracies .
this is a clear signal that the carbon era has reached a turning point ; as a result , there will be more investment in renewable energy .
I am pleased that two initiatives launched in Paris will take us farther down the renewable-energy path .
with more money moving around , businesses re@@ hire employees and ask existing employees to work more hours .
it is their recruitment strategy by which to stoke the fires of East-West hatred and render them significant players . &quot;
a potential Grexit will present entirely new challenges to China in the coming months , and the country must avoid complacency over its own exposure . a battle plan for both the present and the future is needed now .
and , sure enough , what we are seeing now , 16 years after the eurozone institutionalized those relationships , is the anti@@ thesis of democracy : many European leaders want to see the end of Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras &apos;s leftist government .
long-term stagnation and high unemployment are the likely result of confrontation with the eurozone , which leaves only the path of renegotiation .
the good news is that regional crisis-management tools have lately been strengthened considerably , especially since the summer of 2012 , when the euro came very close to collapsing .
but these buffers would be severely strained if the gathering storms conver@@ ged into a single devastating g@@ ale .
and Greece &apos;s profligacy was epic .
but , beginning in 1996 , the US Congress did away with those tax breaks , without producing any blueprint for development .
so they contemplated only a &quot; thin &quot; globalization , with capital flows restricted largely to long-term lending and borrowing .
what is more certain is that the presence of armed fighters in a neighborhood provokes aerial attacks that destroy civilian infrastructure and ma@@ im and kill those residents who have not fled .
French President Nicolas Sarkozy has raised this issue , and he is right to do so .
of course , specific priorities vary by country .
though hacking is as old as wireless itself , much has changed since Mar@@ coni &apos;s time .
Egypt also worries about a possible Hamas-@@ Fatah civil war .
in the West Bank , under Fatah rule , negotiations have gone nowhere .
such a campaign actually dishear@@ tens the relative moderates who , feeling sold out , will try to cut their own deal with Tehran .
yet his frugal lifestyle shows that he does not particularly enjoy spending large amounts of money .
thus , the negotiation will not really be between the UK and the EU , but rather among EU members .
if public-sector investment were to be increased with no rise in taxation , the budget cuts required elsewhere to avoid unsustainable debt growth would be@@ in implau@@ sibly large .
while the outrage that followed the appointment of another European as IMF Managing Director in 2011 is likely to ensure that the Fund &apos;s next head will not hail from Europe , the IMF &apos;s fast-@@ diminishing role means that it will not matter much .
I br@@ ac@@ ed myself for their criticisms .
the researchers also found that the disposition that makes someone successful may also comprise the personality traits that explain their tendency to exploit .
as Huntington suggested , when young people see their economies grow , they begin to demand participation in decisions that affect all aspects of their lives , not just their economic well-being .
addressing the needs of aging populations is the biggest challenge facing health-care companies and payers .
like many people , I thought that small , innovative companies dominated functional foods .
more convincing will be data shared by individuals and collected ( with permission ) by third parties .
helicopter money could take many forms .
in today &apos;s deflationary environment , the reverse has happened .
this stimulated rapid inflation , which was brought under control only after the reconstruction following World War II .
for others , central banks &quot; balance sheets are not a constraint , because the exclusive ability to create additional unlimited and cost-free liabilities guarantees long-term profitability .
so when the dollar &apos;s convertibility into gold was suspended , the value of that debt soared , threatening many institutions &quot; survival .
the Fed has indicated that it will eventually end its program of long-term asset purchases and allow rates to rise to more normal levels .
this month &apos;s International Monetary Fund ( IMF ) meetings in Washington will bring together the world &apos;s top finance ministers and central bankers at a critical juncture for the global economy .
in principle , such a depreciation against all of the world &apos;s currencies is manageable .
a second negative side effect , according to Cec@@ che@@ tti and Khar@@ r@@ oub@@ i , stems from the preference of bank finance for investment in real estate , where collateral is available , rather than less easily assessed investments in technology-based businesses .

India is not , of course , the only nation to retain severe puni@@ shments for homosexuality .
this is where they are on sound footing and can advance positive goals .
those seeking closer economic integration have a special responsibility to be strong advocates of global governance reforms : if authority over domestic policies is ceded to supranational bodies , then the drafting , implementation , and enforcement of the rules and regulations has to be particularly sensitive to democratic concerns .
military assistance should support a political plan , not serve as a substitute for one .
but new legislation is something of a luxury for Europe these days .
institutional improvements help , but they can come later .
beyond constitutional stric@@ tures specific to the Italian context , the question goes to the heart of democratic legitimacy .
there are good reasons to believe that the latter course is more likely to bring electoral success and stymie the dangers posed by Trump .
the lower dollar also reduces the purchasing power of oil exporters .
the outcome will be messy .
powerful business interests will lobby for different policies when they believe that fiscal stimulus yields only inflation than when they believe that it generates higher aggregate demand .
but this is not an option for NGOs that focus only on emergency responses .
the international community should also be concerned with the coup &apos;s regional implications .
they will be driven to tolerate higher inflation as a means of forcing investors into real assets , to accelerate deleveraging , and as a mechanism for facilitating downward adjustment in real wages and home prices .
but when even leaders who are normally considered to be responsible statesmen , such as Italian Prime Minister Matteo Renzi , begin justifying Putin &apos;s actions , Europe risks f@@ rit@@ tering away the very security on which its prosperity is built .
the SDG framework has been the subject of a year of widespread consultation , lobbying , and debate .
the International Red Cross and others started complaining about abuses as early as December 2002 .
becoming a member is a seven-year process of induc@@ tion and indoctrination .
progress along such a path requires &quot; national &quot; citizens to begin viewing themselves increasingly as &quot; global &quot; citizens , with interests that extend beyond their state &apos;s borders .
this supportive context provided a roadmap for national policymakers , helping them to build democratic institutions and marginalize extremists .
political enemies are collaborating to minimize security risks , and religious leaders advocate coexistence and tolerance .
at the same time , setting eurozone members apart from the wider EU would be in@@ advisable .
moreover , these women tend to have unrealistic notions about their economic paths .
and whatever modest improvements they may feel in their lives were also secured elsewhere , at a far lower economic and political cost .
these health problems will be concentrated in densely populated areas with high P@@ M concentrations , especially cities in China and India .
conflict resolution , if it is to be successful , requires channeling the energy generated by conflict toward constructive and nonviolent alternatives .
the world will need more cooperation in the coming years , as climate change begins to interact with and exacerbate extreme weather events , in order to gain the lead@@ -@@ time needed to prepare for disasters .
the whole point of the Cold War was to ensure that a hot one would be prevented .
no state is static , and Israel has changed a great deal since the heroic decades after its founding in 1948 .
in foreign policy , the US is seen as either a swag@@ gering bully or a dithering c@@ oward .
but there is no evidence for that at all .
those who leak news of domestic and foreign surveillance are arrested , and the use of lethal drones has increased .
in normal business transactions , customers can buy goods and service with conventional currencies .
it is time to recognize their utopian rhetoric for what it is : self-serving nonsense meant to separate cred@@ ulous investors from their hard-earned savings .
fish learn to avoid unpleasant experiences , like electric shocks . and painkillers reduce the symptoms of pain that they would otherwise show .
it also risks exposing the IMF to even heavier political pressure , accentu@@ ating legitimate questions about the uniformity of its treatment of member countries .
in fact , one could debate the question of Greece &apos;s debt sustainability endlessly .
second , under her leadership , the IMF has also addressed the broader question of income inequality .
there is one more prerequisite for sustainable growth : relative peace and security .
economists are not really surprised at this .
the other scenario is when the two sides have already engaged in bilateral peace talks , paid the domestic political price , and reached agreement on most issues , though some matters remain unresolved and threaten to derail the process .
but it will soon be impossible to ignore .
a plethora of centers for the study of business and government relations have been created , and researchers have produced a large literature on the design , analysis , and evaluation of public-private partnerships .
as services became increasingly tradable , manufacturing declined steadily as a share of employment , from 40 % in 1960 to about 20 % today .
beyond the obvious practical problems this has raised , it has imp@@ inged on many citizens &quot; sense of identity .
for example , the AIIB &apos;s inaugural president , J@@ in Li@@ qu@@ n , has announced plans to eliminate some of the most inefficient features of existing institutions , like the resident board and nationality restrictions on hiring .
the real problem is that the Republican Party has , over the years , become a hollow instrument of lobbyists and extremists , and both Democrats and Republicans seem to have abandoned their commitment to governing by consensus .
since becoming prime minister in 2014 , he has led an enthusiastic campaign to expand digital governance , ha@@ iling its efficiency and ext@@ olling its capacity to transform the country .
&quot; what is important , &quot; he grudgingly conceded , &quot; is that it was built by the blood and swe@@ at of India &apos;s farmers and laborers . &quot;

and the recent spate of attacks reveals a serious problem with the country &apos;s trajectory under Modi .
Modi &apos;s domestic performance has also been under@@ whel@@ ming .
the robustness of India &apos;s prin@@ t-@@ newspaper industry cannot be attributed to lack of growth in Internet access : in the last decade , the share of the population with Internet access rose from less than 10 % to some 30 % .
Tibet , India &apos;s government says , is an integral part of China , and India lends no support to those who would challenge that status .
but there is more about this than politics .
Indian society seems to have become more globalized than its government .
and , as with the older castes , there is no need for any qualification for the vocation ; birth alone is sufficient .
as usual , India tempered its response , even inviting Pakistan to join in an official investigation of the attack .
it is a brave and slightly risky strategy , because it obliges India to pursue a similar course of action when the next significant terrorist strike occurs .
Suharto &apos;s action marked the beginning of the end of the Su@@ kar@@ no era , and the birth of his &quot; New Order &quot; : the pro-Western , business-friendly regime that would govern Indonesia for the next three decades .
there are others , including the question of inheritance taxes , which have long been regarded as a necessary component of a free society .
in the US , income inequality has steadily widened under both Democratic and Republican administrations .
public diplomacy and the power to attract and persuade become increasingly important , but public diplomacy is changing .
the easiest would be to spread the money around to scientists in academia , product-@@ development partnerships , biotech firms , and larger pharmaceutical companies as opportunities arise .
as a result , the interest rate for 12-month fixed deposits has reached 3.@@ 9 % .
in the US , the inflation rate has also been depressed by the rise in the value of the dollar relative to the euro and other currencies , which has caused import prices to decline .
though financing for public infrastructure has returned to 2008 levels , little of it is being funne@@ led into new projects .
in the last several years , the initiative process has led to re@@ distric@@ ting in Arizona , and ran@@ ke@@ d-@@ choice voting in Maine .

despite the value that smaller companies bring to the region &apos;s customers and economies , first-time business owners too often are on their own .
as Dominique Strauss-Kahn , then France &apos;s finance minister , put it in 1997 , &quot; People who are married do not want others in the bedroom . &quot;
they had no stake beyond the immediate &quot; sale . &quot;
none of this suggests that Iranian intentions can be taken on trust .
this trend will continue , as Africa and Asia become robust markets for Turkey &apos;s construction firms , information technology , and green innovations .
everyone wants economic stability , and many are reluctant to abandon today what gave them stability yesterday .
Smith &apos;s book was much talked about from the beginning , and the evidence supports its argument .
but the United States economy does not exist in a vacuum .
the United States can no longer be counted on to uphold , much less enforce , existing rules , and countries more broadly cannot be assumed to agree on , much less adhere to , a common set of norms .
obviously , cyber technology is very different from nuclear technology , particularly because non-governmental actors can exploit it much more easily .
some argue that the problem is competitive depreciation or too-low interest rates ; others maintain that the real problem is overvalued currencies or too-@@ high interest rates .
for example , a year after Romania decrimin@@ alized abortion in 1990 , maternal deaths fell by half , while in South Africa , deaths plummeted 91 % in the first four years after passage of the 1996 Choice on Ter@@ min@@ ation of P@@ reg@@ nan@@ cy Act .
but is that &quot; unless &quot; really so far-fetched ?
do we value what we get from Net@@ fli@@ x , YouTube , Facebook , and the Internet &apos;s online library of humanity far more than what we previously learned , listened to , watched , or gossi@@ ped about through traditional means ?
by making vaccines available through national immunization programs , governments can protect all children from the diseases that are most likely to harm or kill them .
but , in addition to supporting Liu &apos;s achievements by making certain that they are represented at the ceremony in Oslo , world leaders need to come to grips with the Chinese government &apos;s reaction .
innovation hates a vacuum : if the US fails to boost its support for science and technology , other countries should and will fill the void .
the real enemy is American leaders &quot; own lack of vision .
at its heart , Costa Rica &apos;s approach to climate change is about people , not industry and markets .
unless all of us do so , the consequences will spare none of us .
but , despite these potential drawbacks , an armed attack on Iran &apos;s nuclear facilities will and should remain a distinct possibility given the enormous strategic costs of a nuclear-armed Iran .
such measures include assisting the Green Movement so that it can maintain access to the Internet , introducing additional sanctions aimed at the Revolutionary Guard , and publicly supporting the political and legal rights of the Iranian people .
and , in a speech of great depth , Mohamed Morsi , the first Egyptian president to visit Iran since the Islamic Republic &apos;s birth in 1979 , firmly rejected the Syrian regime , as he did in a subsequent appearance before the Arab League as well .
it keeps intact a global non-proliferation regime that has been showing signs of falling apart , and gives new hope for wider regional security cooperation .
Kennedy felt stuck : should he sanction the planned CIA invasion of Cuba or veto it ?
this position was accompanied by Iran &apos;s harder line on military involvement in the Syrian civil war , echoed by its Lebanese proxy Hezbollah .
in this confrontation , international credibility and legitimacy will be the deciding factors , and ensuring them will require far-sighted and cool , calculated American leadership .
and Israel &apos;s potent air force would never allow a meaningful Iranian military presence in Syria .
moderates advocated for more responsible foreign policy and caution on the country &apos;s nuclear program .
in terms of domestic policy , the major challenge for the next president will be the economy .
what led Israel to war in 1967 was not a sound assessment of Egypt &apos;s intentions to attack , but fear of a second Sho@@ ah .
we have continued to pursue these initiatives in the post-@@ Saddam era , engaging in confidence-building measures with our immediate neighbors in order to offset extra-@@ regional ag@@ itations .
the IRGC prisoners in Iraq were released , but Britain did not apologize or admit wrong-@@ doing in return .
it is important to remember : those who were responsible for taking the British Marines captive wanted an escalation of the confrontation , both to improve their domestic standing , and to punch back for sanctions that were beginning to bite .
continued fighting in Iraq could also lead to regional war .
none of Iraq &apos;s neighbors , including Iran , would benefit from sectarian conflict that grows into a regional war .
this ambiguity in Iraq is a good example of the problem faced by Arab democratic reformers elsewhere .
but this also has a potentially dangerous drawback , too .
Iraq &apos;s population , frankly , is bleeding away .
American behavior and self-@@ perceptions reveal the ease with which a civilized country can engage in large-scale killing of civilians without public discussion .
unlike in 2009 , the Irish government is protesting the EU authorities &quot; recent Apple ruling , pointing out that tax policy is in the purview of national governments , not the Union .
now , after a lengthy and difficult period of reflection and bargaining , those efforts may be in jeopardy again .
the new knowledge produced by original research is an instance of social capital formation .

banks serve a special function in the economy that does warrant a special role for the government : not in setting pay , but in imposing effective capital requirements .
true , some of China &apos;s fiscal stimulus effectively consists of loans to the private sector via the highly controlled banking sector .
it would be preferable for China to find a way to substitute Chinese for US private consumption demand , but the system seems unable to move quickly in this direction .
in 2011 we may begin to see whether those incentives lead China &apos;s rulers to re-@@ app@@ raise their diplomatic conduct , which has left them with only the corrupt , basket case economies of Burma and North Korea as reliable friends in Asia .
they may strive to improve their performance , but often they do so for its own sake , for the sense of achievement .
the ECB has bought time , but it has also raised the stakes .
since last year , prices have declined in the US .
until recently , the region maintained a trade surplus with the US , but with liberalization , the region will increase imports of more affordable goods , thereby turning the surplus into a deficit .
moreover , trade in agricultural products will benefit US exporters more than Central American farmers .
this cannot involve the creation of working groups that merely pay lip service to ethical debate , but must enable non-@@ sports organizations to develop their own policy framework for the regulation of &quot; gene d@@ oping &quot; and , more broadly , the use of genetic information .

Qutb was executed by the Egyptian dictator Gamal Abdel Nasser in 1966 as part of a brutal but unsuccessful attempt to eliminate the Muslim Brotherhood .
simply put , despite great potential , many O@@ IC countries have struggled to achieve broad-based development .
instability places enormous strain on national budgets .
to realize this potential , Islamic finance , no less than its conventional counterpart , needs an appropriate enabling environment , one characterized by a level playing field , an adequate regulatory framework , and effective partnerships .
moreover , efforts to Islam@@ ic@@ ize the state comes at a time when conflict in the Middle East has further politicized Muslim movements in Malaysia .
this was typical of CIA operations : relying on improvi@@ sed funding through a wealthy Saudi family and proceeds from local smuggling and the narcotics trade .
some of the consequences of a Western-@@ backed Arab invasion of the caliphate are no less predictable for being &quot; unintended . &quot;

reform Judaism in Germany resulted in religious and cultural particul@@ arism yielding to a far greater degree of universalism than was envisaged at any time in the Jewish past .
if asked in a referendum , the British might well leave the EU , which they never liked .

the Dialogue was not exactly an edi@@ fying success , however .
yes , Netanyahu was humbled by the electorate , but his loss of support was not a victory for the peace camp .
but hypocrisy is not what is most disturbing about this particular campaign .
a sni@@ p@@ pet from the ad : &quot; to those who scapegoat Israel ... yet remain silent about the oppression and violence Hamas , Iran and other countries inflict on the gay community : shame on you .

whereas inward investment reached $ 20 billion in 2008 , capital outflows totaled $ 20 billion in 2009 .
that mistake was made by the Japanese , who tried , unsuccessfully , to muddle through , only to end up with 18 years of stagnation .
in the Czech Republic last year , the budget deficit jumped to 13 % of GDP , a threefold increase since 1999 .
note that this estimate is of the TPP &apos;s effect on the level of aggregate income after 15 years , not of its impact on the annual growth rate .
and one day , if true change happens , they might even decide to return home .
in this sense , economic crises are almost bound to undermine political stability .
as matters stand , the financial sector is too closed , and it provides too little funding and support for new ventures .
real disposable income per capita dropped precipitously in 2009-@@ 2012 , and remains below pre-crisis levels , which were already below the prevailing levels prior to Italy &apos;s adoption of the euro .
Renzi has vigorously back@@ ped@@ aled from his conditional vow to step down ; but if voters reject the Senate reform , he will become a lame duck , and political stability will most likely suffer unless he keeps his promise .

it is not for lack of political representation .
but Swensen is an academic , with a Ph.D. in economics .
when an analytical mind , a mind that is trained to search rigorously for the truth and as part of a community of such people is set free from self-doubt , it can do amazing things .
but , after Zhao and other parents protested that the government &apos;s compensation plan was inadequate to cover the cost of their children &apos;s ongoing medical care , they began to receive threats from local police .
Zhao &apos;s allies are not out to &quot; humiliate China . &quot;
nor is it always the case that mainstream parties can cut off support for extremists by selectively co@@ opting their complaints and demands .
Japan adopted similar policies in late 2012 to escape two decades of stagnation .
now , thanks to bad policies , and even worse politicians , it ranks among the world &apos;s al@@ so-@@ rans .
and , in a significant way , its prosperity makes its failures difficult to address .
amendments require a two-thirds majority in both chambers of the Diet , and a majority in a popular referendum , making Japan &apos;s constitution one of the world &apos;s most difficult to revise .
in any case , the particul@@ arities of the eurozone &apos;s structure mean that the ECB will have no choice but to halt its bond-buying operations in a year or so .
while the recent announcement of bilateral talks postpones Trump &apos;s threat of auto tariffs against Japan , critics worry that Trump may push Japan closer to China , whose president , Xi Jinping , is scheduled to hold a summit with Prime Minister Shinzo Abe later this month .
this national characteristic is not limited to individuals .
instead , the paper &apos;s authors argued that Japan &apos;s &quot; lost decades &quot; of anemic growth and deflation could have been avoided had policymakers shifted to stimulus more quickly and with far greater force .
in the meantime , politicians are lulled into a false sense of complacency that undermines their incentive to confront the structural challenges they face .
and therein lies one explanation for the apparent lack of right-wing populism in Japan .
and yet , he shares right-wing populists &quot; hostility to liberal academics , journalists , and intellectuals .
despite its two decades of economic malaise , Japan remains the world &apos;s third-largest economy , and will grow by about 2 % this year and 1.5 % in 2013 .
it almost seems as if Japan is bent on self-@@ isolation in Asia .

the emerging markets developed the institutions and the skills base needed to import and adapt technology , which is easier than generating new technology from scratch .

and yet the US did not preemptively attack Soviet missile sites , which were relatively vulnerable , because the risk that even one or two of the Soviet missiles would be fired at an American city was enough to deter a first strike .

the situation in the Middle East and the Sahel is certainly dire , with rapid desertification devastating pastoral economies and the livelihoods of farmers , shepher@@ ds , nom@@ ads , and those who depend on them .
difficult wars , erosion of the nuclear non-proliferation regime by North Korea and Iran , and deterioration of the Middle East peace process .
Bush and Cheney &apos;s hard-power approach certainly did not solve these problems .
moreover , in addition to words , there have been some important deeds .
this compares poorly with the most recent estimate of a reasonably safe level of CO2 emissions calculated by the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change .
as output and consumption become more stable , investors do not demand as large a risk premium .
it has conducted fair trials and has provided a meaningful app@@ el@@ late process that has led to significant convictions and equally significant acqu@@ it@@ tals .
to meet this challenge , we have designed an economic strategy that rests on three pillars : Europe , fiscal consolidation , and competitiveness .
but an endgame for that country is a dangerous illusion : the game will not end , and neither will history .
governments now face the difficult task of implementing reforms that will hit the majority of voters hardest .
to pursue this course , however , will require standing up to Israel and Saudi Arabia .
but the more the US and authoritarian Arab regimes attacked the station , the more the station became a refl@@ ec@@ tor of some of the radical Islamic trends .
it is always useful to have a scapegoat .
all of them have it wrong .
so I am convinced that we should raise the profile of biodiversity in tackling climate change and food insecurity , and that we need more high-level attention to this subject .
moreover , no one can guarantee that intervention would not quickly lead to another war with Israel .

digital maps can be as dynamic as the communities that they depic@@ t .
but there is hope amid the gloom .
slower growth means less revenue , and a faster downward spiral .
but America has also grown up in another way , learning to choose transparency over secrecy , and to rely on the power of its citizens .
and Brazil , like India a genuine democracy , also seems su@@ i gener@@ is .
other American officials have taken to calling PT@@ A &apos;s &quot; trade agreements for the twenty-first century . &quot;
even where there is accord in principle , there is little agreement in practice .
the Chinese do it all . &quot;
he has brought in plan@@ e@@ loads of journalists to Guantánamo Bay to show them a &quot; safe , transparent , and humane &quot; facility that now offers fresh b@@ ak@@ la@@ va and video viewing from a shackled lo@@ ve@@ seat .
illegal immigrants perform a substantial share of the state economy &apos;s men@@ ial and physically demanding work .
but Europe would thrive on the cosmopolitan dynamism that results from treating immigration as an opportunity rather than as a threat .
similarly , the European Union has long advocated a two-state solution , with Palestine being established on areas occupied by Israel in 1967 .
as Abbas has said , the upcoming General Assembly vote is not aimed at de@@ legitimizing Israel .
more flexible labor markets and reform of entitlement programs would further allow Europe to confront the demands of greater competition without recourse to insular protections , such as those placed on labor migration .
if Merkel &apos;s government believes that paying lip service to growth is enough , it is playing with fire : a euro collapse in which not only Germans would be badly burned .
rising sea levels , drought in Africa , and increasingly turbulent storms all pose a new type of threat that must be taken seriously .
but success brings new challenges .
according to China &apos;s National Au@@ dit Office ( NA@@ O ) , these LF@@ Ps &quot; total borrowing amounts to R@@ M@@ B@@ 1@@ 0.7 trillion , of which 7@@ 9.1 % is bank loans .
thus , the first danger to worry about for 2005 and beyond - when world interest rates will most likely rise - is another wave of emerging-market financial crises .
it is during such periods - particularly when asset values fall swiftly and substantially - that we discover exactly how good our central bankers are at their main job : reducing financial volatility and promoting economic stability .
while protecting health is a legitimate government purpose , crimin@@ alizing drug use to protect people from harming themselves does not meet the criteria of necessity or proportionality . &quot;
rethinking requires a new ideology , and , after one country has shown the right direction , neighbors often follow .
South Korean President Lee Myung-bak , through his flip-flo@@ ps , and Kim J@@ ong Il , with his renewed nuclear blackmail , both seem determined to see relations deteriorate .
the EU bet here is that , on the back of Croatia &apos;s accession , the enlargement log@@ jam in the western Balkans will finally be broken .
in the absence of close and broad international cooperation , the US must join the race and lower its corporate-tax rate .
many analysts viewed this policy , which introduced a small degree of previously non-existent competition among commercial banks , as a sign that China would soon liberalize interest rates further .
but any further move toward interest-rate liberalization must account for all potential costs and benefits .
another major risk of interest-rate liberalization in China stems from rising public debt , particularly local-government debt , which has grown significantly in the wake of the global financial crisis .
but it is no exaggeration to state that whenever Britain has perceived an opportunity to wage a war of attrition against the European supranational project , it has done so , opposing any substantial increase in the EU &apos;s competences or resources .
the crisis also revealed the extent of the massive over-@@ capacity in the US retail market , with estimates that at least one-fifth of American shopping malls would be forced to close .
Thaksin &apos;s rapid reversal of political fortune attests to the limits of the ballot box , as well as to democratic shortcomings that now beset a host of developing countries , including regional neighbors such as the Philippines .
the Sweden Democrats ( S@@ D ) , a party with roots in the country &apos;s white-@@ supremac@@ ist movement , entered the parliament for the first time in September 2010 , with the support of 5.7 % of the Swedish electorate .
but this continuing silence by the guilty only transfers the costs to society as a whole , with Chinese life distorted by the weight of lies and ev@@ asions .
domestic political pressure became a source of heightened international tension .
photos and video cli@@ ps of police beating civilians in Tehran and other cities have been disseminated on the Internet .
some parts of the world are doing better than others in this respect .
once these industries figured out how to make their IT systems more efficient , interoper@@ able , and user-friendly , and then realigned their processes to leverage technology &apos;s capabilities , productivity soared .
the resulting supply constraints exacerbated inflation .
with around one billion people living in high-income countries , it would thus cost just $ 2 to $ 3 per person per year in the developed world to fund an effort that could save more than one million children annually .
but too many American leaders are shirking this responsibility .
in the Indian states of Andhra Pradesh and Gujarat , for example , emergency am@@ bul@@ ance services are now within reach of tens of millions of people , supported by cell phones , sophisticated computer systems , and increased public investments in rural health .
if dying bees do not inspire formal guidelines about how the sky should be shared , let us hope that empty space will .
who better than Europeans , who brought communism to life , exported it to the world , and then paid dearly for it over many decades , know better about the tor@@ ments inflicted upon the Cuban people ?

despite all of the pain caused by the Great Recession , there is no sign that the world is forsa@@ king the greenback .
should we blame the &quot; British Revolution &quot; of 2010 on E-@@ 15 ? this undoubtedly would be going too far .
others point out that China has engaged in &quot; good neighbor &quot; policies since the 1990 &quot; s , settled border disputes , played a greater role in international institutions , and recognized the benefits of using soft power .
what also needs to be jettisoned from the ECB &apos;s communications policy is its obsession with the short run .
as long as such a &quot; one-@@ pil@@ lar@@ -@@ approach &quot; is unavailable , there is no convincing reason why the ECB should change a strategy which has served it well and allowed it to establish a remarkable track record .
yes , there is ample reason for concern .
the deployment shows NATO &apos;s enduring commitment to its core task : safeguarding its members &quot; security .
NATO itself embodies that goal .
that is an extraordinary gap in the returns that you can reasonably expect .
moreover , disruptive technologies will cause value to shift among economic sectors , as occurred when television overtook radio or , more recently , when online media gained predominance over print publication .
the question we examined is how to achieve happiness in a world that is characterized by rapid urbanization , mass media , global capitalism , and environmental degradation .
but government spending has continued to grow , because voters still want the services that government provides .
University classes become larger , which means that students are taught less effectively .
yet an analysis of Chile &apos;s voucher program found no positive effect on students &quot; test scores or years in school .
to be sure , such accusations are especially common in autocracies whose rulers , and their apo@@ logists , view the idea of universal human rights as a threat to their monopoly on power .
China has not fared too badly , largely because its government was forced by the Burmese example , bad publicity surrounding the Tibetan demonstrations , and the impending Olympic Games to allow far more freedom of information than it normally does .
once again , the US Federal Reserve is in the eye of the storm .
developing economies are now feeling the full force of the Fed &apos;s moment of reckoning .
the End of the Special R@@ el@@ ation@@ ship ?
the underlying rate of labor productivity growth in the US , which we pegged at 1.2 % per year at the start of the Clinton administration and at 2 % to 2.5 % per year at the end of the 1990 &apos;s boom , now seems even higher : it is getting harder and harder to keep the estimated labor productivity growth trend below 3 % per year .
the effect was to impose further hardship on the Palestinians .
in economic terms , such demand is highly &quot; in@@ el@@ astic &quot; : the mandate must be met at any price .
citizenship tests are an integral part of this program ; and , in the eyes of critics , they resemble &quot; loyalty oaths &quot; and other intolerant measures traditionally associated with the anti-communist wit@@ ch-@@ hunts of McCar@@ thy@@ ism in 1950 &quot; s America .
the gamble has been that a solid , durable recovery would enable banks and households to rebuild their balance sheets quickly enough to avoid the need for additional bailouts .
the Merkel doctrine holds that the crisis is the result of government profligacy , so only a &quot; hard &quot; balanced-budget rule can prevent such crises from recurring .
as a result , the difference between the debt positions of Finland and Italy , the most prudent and most profligate euro-zone members , shot up to 7@@ 3.3 percentage points in 2009 .
unfortunately , such talk could well become a self-fulfilling prophecy .
economic integration , it was hoped , would lead to greater understanding , underpinned by the myriad interactions that inevitably flow from commerce .
far from being a voluntary association , the eurozone is now held together by harsh discipline ; far from being an association of equals it has become a hierarchical arrangement in which the center dictates policy while the periphery is increasingly subordin@@ ated ; instead of fraternity and solidarity , hostile stereotypes proliferate .
fearing the costs of an invasion of Gaza &apos;s urban alle@@ ys , Israel handed a strategic victory to Hamas .
there is no hiding these facts from American voters anymore .
any China-bashing and protectionist pleas this time around will most likely ring just as hollow .
wages continue to rise , reducing competitiveness vis-à-vis low-income economies , but the growth model is not yet equipped to support competitiveness in high-skill industries , leading to stagnation .
lack of confidence is reflected in low and volatile asset values .
it may be too soon to say that many risky assets have reached bubble levels , and that leverage and risk-taking in financial markets is becoming excessive .
even when the Fed starts to raise interest rates ( some time in 2015 ) , it will proceed slowly .
for now , the Taliban are on the run , some with shaved be@@ ards and some in bur@@ qas , to avoid being recognized and thrashed .
as US Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke has argued , trade expansion inevitably creates some losers , whose protests distract attention from the benefits of globalization .
what remains to be seen is how the end will come .
if a 7@@ 47 crashed into a nuclear facility , we would be unlikely to hear calls for all airplanes to be outlawed , but the clam@@ or for every reactor on the planet to be shut down immediately would probably be deafening .
does this blo@@ gger ever say anything negative , or is she always talking about the great products she uses ?
the challenge of course , is that each kind of product has a different structure and a different set of attributes .
Power@@ set , a tool for creating and defining such relationships in any sphere of interest , is broader but less deep .
we are now at the halfway point .
one senior G-8 official told me that the aid promises are all lies anyway .
in the past , top North Korean leaders tended to calculate carefully the costs and benefits when they acted to put pressure on the outside world .
America , Israel , and much of the international community then torpedoed that arrangement .
insolvent businesses close , bad loans are written off , and lenders can lend with new confidence again .
of course , this does not mean that the EU could or would want to conquer the rest of the world in the name of imposing its values , rules and culture on the rest of humanity .
when the Turkish Parliament attempted to elect the president on April 27 , Gul did not receive enough votes to win on the first ballot .
that decline was primarily the result of more unfavorable apprais@@ als of the current economic situation , but also reflected another downward revision of expectations for the next six months .
and how could that cost be financed if the proposed taxes on existing health policies and the reductions in Medicare outlays have already been used ?
in May , I went to the site of the Tunisian protests ; in July , I talked to Spain &apos;s indig@@ nad@@ os ; from there , I went to meet the young Egyptian revolutionaries in Cairo &apos;s Tahrir Square ; and , a few weeks ago , I talked with Occupy Wall Street protesters in New York .
relatively insignificant as this suffering may be from the perspective of eter@@ nity , the world would be better without it , or at least without most of it .
indeed , in but half a century , Latin Americans rid themselves of all of that continent &apos;s military and civilian dictatorships , and Africa has eliminated more than half of the despots that have blighted its era of independence .
taxpayers end up paying for these exposures , as do retirees and others who rely on returns from their savings .
foreign students now dominate many US doctoral programs , accounting for 64 % of PhDs in computer science , for example .
similar stories are told by organ vendors I have met from the former Soviet states , the Middle East , and Asia .
but the current Bush administration has been hacking away at these 1970 &quot; s laws from all directions .
he approved oil exploration in closed nature reserves , and also systematically fought to suppress scientific evidence on climate change .

yet green jobs are not enough .
clearly , the Asia-Pacific region takes precedence in US calculations .
facing greater challenges in delivering desired outcomes , they have essentially pushed both policies and their brand power to the limit .
having seen the peoples of Central Europe free themselves from Soviet domination just two years before , the constituent nations of the USSR were beginning to seek the same freedom for themselves .
traditionally Asian Uzbekistan and Turkmenistan have resumed the tribal forms of autocracy they practiced throughout the centuries .
if Fatah refuses to join a coalition , Hamas may opt for a government of independents and technocrats .
it is unlikely that Hamas will form a government composed of hardliners .
indeed , under Chen &apos;s policy , Taiwan nearly became a rigi@@ dly divided society , where &quot; local &quot; and &quot; not native &quot; Chinese lived as potential enemies .
the spectacular profits on Wall Street and elsewhere in the financial industry also have a huge macroeconomic impact .
but , like any family secret that would cause us discomfort if faced directly , we Western women turn a blind eye to it .
the History at the End of History
among some technocrats &quot; obvious disadvantages are lack of managerial experience , lack of perceived legitimacy , and lack of a domestic power base .
and the IMF went from issuing warnings to calling our Budget &apos; essential &quot; Now we must implement some of the key decisions required by that Budget .
as the world enters the Information Age , most countries are still experiencing the Agricultural and Industrial A@@ ges .
the implication is that potential borrowers are not absorbing as many imports as they could and not relying , as they should , on the multilateral pooling of reserves that the Fund is meant to use to &quot; give confidence &quot; to its members .
the biggest successes of Obama &apos;s first term concerned economic inclusion .
the deficit was relatively mild until 1999 , when the economy went into recession .
but agricultural subsidies have consequences for China and other developing countries .
while it &apos;s true that tax preferences might yield slightly higher private savings , the loss of tax revenues would more than offset the gains , thereby actually reducing national savings .
if that was supposed to be a better outcome than an earlier termin@@ ation of the pregnancy , it is hard to see for whom it was better .
while these issues are global , they are most urgent in emerging markets , where they are undermining the social and economic progress on which the rest of the world increasingly relies .
the India media bli@@ tz was a huge success .
it both sets the normative framework for EU policy and establishes institutions and procedures for policies on border controls , asylum , reception of migrants , and cooperation between judicial and police authorities .
Mussolini established the first Corpor@@ atist economy , albeit substituting &quot; F@@ asci@@ st &quot; for &quot; Catholic &quot; throughout .
state holding companies controlled key listed firms directly ; and associations controlled the rest , reconciling totalitarianism with nominally private ownership .
that means moving away from both the Anglo-Saxon model of unregulated markets and the continental European model of deficit-@@ driven welfare states .
but Russia , China , and other countries felt that NATO exploited the resolution to engineer regime change , rather merely protecting citizens in Libya .
but this is like trying to get fat by buying a larger belt .
political Islam of all colors has emerged as the main alternative to secular Arab nationalist regimes whose legitimacy , based on the struggle for national liberation , has evaporated due to their inability to resolve economic and social problems , establish the rule of law , and guarantee fundamental freedoms .
successive European and American governments share an atavistic fear of the &quot; Islamic alternative &quot; to Arab secular nationalists like Fatah , and so have defended the status quo .
indeed , the Keynesian and Hayek@@ ian explanations of the origins of the crisis are actually not very different , with over-indebtedness playing the key role in both accounts . but the conclusions to which the two theories point are very different .

if this lesson is learned , the world will be far safer .
given this , it is no surprise that the list of question marks attached to Calderón &apos;s administration is longer than that of his achievements .
gaining time before a disastrous confrontation between Israel and Iran becomes inevitable would be smarter than taking an aggressive approach now .
indeed , each side says that the other struck first .
but , unlike the advanced economies , they maintained high GDP growth rates and relative stability even at the height of the crisis .
to begin with its strengths , the nation state remains the only political space in which the constitution of liberty thrives .
the nationalist impulse can be aggressive or defensive , directed against others or inward-looking .
as long as governments do not encroach excessively on central-bank decision-making , this development will restore balance in policymaking and support policy coordination , particularly in times of stress .
we are about to learn that lesson again .
perhaps it is accepted resig@@ ne@@ dly , as the cosmopolitan class is too amorphous and ill-@@ defined to be the target of any social movement .
but the Iraq insurgency devi@@ ates from its forebears in vital ways .
there are , then , three paths for Iraq : evolution of a more serious insurgency , persistent violence at current levels , or resolution of the insurgency .

this shift not only elev@@ ates the importance of the pro-consumption agenda of China &apos;s 12th Five-Year Plan ; it also calls into question the longstanding proactive tactics of the country &apos;s fiscal and monetary authorities .
escalating fears have driven US President Barack Obama to declare repeatedly that any Syrian use or transfer of chemical weapons would cross a &quot; red line , &quot; for which President Bashar al-Assad &apos;s regime would be &quot; held accountable . &quot;
but , to rely on the US government alone to plot the most effective strategy in the shadow of possible internal grou@@ p-@@ think is asking too much .
I hope I am wrong .
worst-case estimates have China &apos;s real GDP growing at around 7 % per year over the next decade .
this development was the first sign that ISIS was actively seeking to develop a cyber capability that it could deploy even if it loses its footing on the ground .

with this outcome being extremely unlikely , the most one can hope for is that the election will soften the blow from Brexit .
that stance puts the UK on course for a &quot; hard Brexit &quot; by April 2019 .
she seems clueless about how an open market economy works , and unaware that international trade , investment , and migration are intertwined .
economists put forward three reasons for the dismal performance of some rich@@ ly endowed countries :
security is not the only area where sovereignty concerns have superseded multilateralism .
others deemed this to be too dangerous in an era defined by nuclear weapons , and the US opted instead for a policy of containment , working to limit the reach of Soviet power and influence .

with the huge debt left behind by the Bush administration , the US should be especially motivated to get the largest possible stimulation from each dollar spent .
so now Germany &apos;s finance ministry , the guardian of fiscal rectitude , is considering measures such as using the European Investment Bank to foster growth , issuing EU &quot; project bonds &quot; to finance infrastructure investment , and allowing wages in Germany to rise at a faster pace than in the rest of Europe .
the only possible response is to point to logic and evidence .
its estimate falls so far short because the reported numbers do not even include the full budgetary costs to the government . and the budgetary costs are but a fraction of the costs to the economy as a whole .
large proportions of NATO allies &quot; armed forces are still better suited for static territorial defense than for the expedi@@ tionary type of operation needed in Afghanistan .
