these lessons apply equally to advanced economies , which also suffer from rising inequality and subtle forms of corruption .
the climate issue can only be solved on the basis of shared , deeply felt ethical principles .

this episode suggests that Koizumi &apos;s hardline position isn &apos;t the only option .
Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu has embarked on a campaign to force President Barack Obama to set a red line that Iran must not cross , lest it risk unleashing an American military response .

why M@@ illenni@@ als Will Re@@ ject Trump
these words &quot; enduring emotional appeal is rooted in their embrace of a potentially difficult course of action , motivated by a pledge to uphold values shared by citizens of America and the world alike .
the need for leadership has never been greater , and the US has never been more engaged with the world .
some countries even impose a constitutional mandate for equality of educational opportunities .
the Democrats also provide Trump an out on North Korea .
but there were major differences in the relative power resources of imperial Britain and contemporary America .
in the twenty-first century , it has showed how devastating a lack of such leadership can be .
so will uncertainty about who will be President in 2013 ; about tax rates and spending levels ; about the threat of another government shutdown over the debt ceiling ; and about the risk of another sovereign rating downgrade should political gridlock continue to block a plan for medium-term fiscal consolidation .
the US , as the dominant postwar power , pursued its own interests , whether the British liked it or not .
simple arithmetic and basic economics tell us that a multilateral problem cannot be addressed by a bilateral solution .

but the most important matter that went un@@ mentioned in Strasbourg is the relationship with Russia .
his budget would also increase taxes on corporations , and would end the current payroll-tax &quot; holiday , &quot; imposing an additional 2 % tax on all wage earners .
a well-designed combination of caps to limit tax expenditures and a gradual slowing of growth in outlays for entitlement programs could reverse the rise in the debt and strengthen the US economy .
due to its geopolitical position and its potential , however , Russia will remain a permanent strategic factor in Europe and Asia that cannot be ignored .
after all , the best way to generate cooperation and trust is to ensure that it offers clear benefits to all parties involved .
in fact , there is still strong reason for optimism about the region &apos;s prospects .

even the United States had inflation at 4 % last year , though the Federal Reserve is somehow convinced that most people won &apos;t notice .
after several difficult years , the country managed to negotiate an exchange of outstanding bonds for bonds with a considerably lower face value . about 93 % of creditors accepted the exchange and received new bonds with a face value that was about one-quarter of that of the old bonds .

the decision by Hamas to join the political process by participating in the upcoming legislative elections shows that even this hardline Islamic movement has concluded that our conflict needs to be addressed by political rather than military means .
northern Kosovo , now largely under Belgrade &apos;s control , must not be partitioned off in all but name .
it claims that if Kosovo is granted independence , the ul@@ tran@@ ation@@ alist Rad@@ ical Party will come to power in the next elections , and believes that holding elections as early as this year will cause the Con@@ t@@ act Group to delay a proposal to the Security Council .

the problem is that this call is more likely to appeal to the highly educated , already privileged classes than to those who feel disenfranchised in today &apos;s global economy .
the situation has changed considerably since then .
in a recent speech at the National Assembly that recalled Em@@ ile Z@@ ola &apos;s attack on the &quot; blind stup@@ idity &quot; of Jew@@ -@@ hatred almost 120 years ago , he asked : &quot; how can we accept that in France ... sh@@ outs of &quot; Death to the Jews ! &quot; can be heard in our streets ? ...

initial warning signs of a pandemic are most likely to appear in the developing world , but detection nodes should be positioned in every country , with the least possible expense .
candidates for public office , and those holding high administrative or corporate positions , should be judged on their policies and performance , not on private acts that are irrelevant to how well they carry out , or will carry out , their public duties .

even when combined , the first three generations make up barely one-third of the entire Arab population .
the early 2000s held promise for the Arab world , and in today &apos;s youth we can see it renewed .
perhaps they may decide that violence is counter-productive and carries its own penalties , and may then follow the Kurdish example of curbing violence , which would help put Iraq together again without recourse to permanent repression .
at this point , there is likely to be some downward instability in prices , because enthusiasm for investing in houses is likely to wane in line with declining price growth .
instead of looking for changes in genes that take many generations to accumulate until they can be detected , we have measured natural selection directly .
the message of this approach is also clear : natural selection continues to operate in modern cultures .
the new figure was a reasonable admission that the earlier target could not be reached without wrecking the economy .

for most of the twentieth century , programmers were patently unsuccessful in designing chess computers that could compete with the best humans .
and now some analysts suggest that new forms of computer programming will compound these developments , as algorithms , robots , and self-driving cars destroy middle-class jobs and worsen inequality .

he said &quot; no , &quot; because while China had the talents of 1.4 billion people to draw upon , the openness of the US allowed it to tap and combine the talents of 7.5 billion people with greater creativity than China could .
China &apos;s goal is to prevent ASEAN members from uniting against it and to diminish the role of international law in a region where it seeks strategic dominance .

true , many local governments in China are saddled with debt , some of which may need to be restructured .
but Xi &apos;s statement marked a significant departure from China &apos;s long-standing position on America &apos;s presence in the Asia-Pacific region .

instead , it bases its legitimacy on rapid economic growth and ethnic Han nationalism .
the fears of China &apos;s rulers , I suspect , do not bode well for reaching a peaceful resolution of its territorial disputes in the South and East China Seas .
just as Germany &apos;s rapid ascent prior to World War I spurred a &quot; triple entente &quot; among France , Russia , and the United Kingdom , China &apos;s increasingly assertive behavior is creating strong impetus for the Asia-Pacific democracies to build a more powerful coalition .
already , US President Donald Trump &apos;s administration has withdrawn his country from the Trans-Pacific Partnership , and confronted US allies on their defense spending and persistent trade imbalances .
with the relentless increase in electricity subsidies , which are squeezing the energy sector , it is difficult to devise effective policies to stem over-pumping .

but its behavior is testing the limits of regional and global understanding and patience .
furthermore , most German investments were based on the transfer of an established technology ; only 8 % of the country &apos;s FDI in the region involved cutting-edge research .
but neither those concerns nor Chinese retaliation will win the US any sympathy , because the administration &apos;s latest action comes on the heels of bogus US steel and aluminum tariffs , trumped up , as it were , on national security grounds .
in 1998 , the Saint Mal@@ o Declaration by French President Jacques Chirac and British Prime Minister Tony Blair indicated both countries &quot; determination to reinforce the EU &apos;s security and defense capabilities .
one possibility is that Putin is not sincere about his aim of doubling Russia &apos;s GDP in a decade .
Putin &apos;s geopolitical preoccupations could be accommodated by sensibly preserving state ownership of pipeline infrastructure in the hydrocarbons sector , while allowing private companies to extract , process , and sell Russia &apos;s oil and gas .
swarms of capitalist &quot; locu@@ sts &quot; threaten to descend on defen@@ seless , hard@@ working people , to quote the unfortunate metaphor used in a recent speech by Fran@@ z Müntefering , the chairman of the governing Social Democrats .
the instinct of governments , however , may be to revert to the idea of protecting national champions or reasserting national sovereignty in some sectors .

whether this is a bubble , destined to collapse , or a sign of a more radical shift in the concept of money , the implications for central banking and financial stability will be profound .
for example , coal is phenomen@@ ally polluting , but it also provides for cheap and reliable power , which drives development .
the fact remains that global wind and solar power usage in 2012 cut , at most , 275 million tons of CO2 , while soaking up $ 60 billion in subsidies .
for example , even as late as 1970 , only around 5 % of infants were vaccinated against measles , tetanus , who@@ oping cough , di@@ phtheria , and polio .

when capital flows out of a country , the transactions are supposed to be reflected in the BO@@ P table .
China has emphasized its cultural and economic strengths , but it has paid less attention to the political aspects that can undermine its efforts .
indeed , China now looks like it can play the role of &quot; growth anchor . &quot;
it is also becoming more sustainable , in line with the shift in its growth model away from investment and exports and toward domestic demand and services .
to its credit , China has already made some efforts to solve its debt problem and begin deleveraging .
the main risk is that a big devaluation would be interpreted as indicating that China &apos;s economic slowdown is far more severe than people think , in which case money would continue to flee .
why There Is No &quot; Beijing Consensus &quot;

this was no earth-@@ shattering event , but financial markets responded as if a me@@ teor@@ ite had struck them .
for China &apos;s sake , and that of its neighbors , one hopes they stick to the free-market plan .
democracy , then , may have a future after all .
the World Trade Organization ( WTO ) is the natural place to negotiate this agreement , but past efforts have failed partly because negotiations were seen as heavily favoring developed countries over developing ones .
in the meantime , the agreement has become obsolete ; China &apos;s economy has nearly doubled in size since the deal was struck .
otherwise , it would risk accelerating the decline of the established international financial institutions .
these targets would require China &apos;s economy to grow at an average annual rate of at least 6.5 % during the next five years .
nonetheless , there is good reason to believe that China can succeed , given that the country &apos;s economic history indicates an impressive capacity for transformation .
those systems essentially delegated more decision-making rights , as well as certain profits , to farmers and workers , so that they had a stronger incentive to work more efficiently within state-owned commun@@ es and firms .

the region is home not only to the world &apos;s fastest-growing economies , but also to the fastest-@@ increasing military expenditures and naval capabilities , the fier@@ cest competition over natural resources , and the most dangerous strategic hot spots . one might even say that it holds the key to global security .
but , while concerns about growth certainly merit attention , they should be viewed in the context of China &apos;s longer-term economic trajectory , especially its emergence as a global hub of innovation .
so companies are developing uniquely Chinese approaches to such innovation .
indeed , one sure way to insult the Chinese is to tell them they should feel lucky , because they have a better government than the Indians or Brazilians .
in recent years , China has been off@@ loading its labor-intensive export sectors to less-developed countries with lower labor costs .

trade policymakers are deeply familiar with this logic , which is why the anti@@ dumping regime exists in its current form , enabling relatively easy protection .
as a recent HSBC report points out , the reasons for China &apos;s rapid accumulation of debt , which is concentrated in the corporate and local-government sectors , suggest that the situation is not nearly as dangerous as many are making it out to be .

but , more fundamentally , it seems to reflect a shift in the way current and developing technologies are being perceived .
education is a classic example .
German voters balk at any suggestion that we should limit the environmental damage caused by big and expensive cars . British voters line up behind the truck drivers when protests are launched against hikes in the price of petrol , not least through the introduction of higher energy taxes .
weak states , of course , tend to be cynical about China &apos;s growing might .
it would be excellent if the general public responded to an appeal for funds for mitigating future damage . but the prospects of that happening are slim , because such an appeal would lack the emotional pull of the desire to help immediate victims .
can Hamas and Fatah put aside their differences and form a unity government ?
how the West responds could very well influence the outcome .
helping Hamas would empower radical Islamism and Iranian ambitions , while undercutting the PA and everyone else , not just Israel .
new money should go to good performers , not just to those who are experiencing debt distress .
aid should preferably be financed out of donor countries &quot; national budgets in a transparent , democratically accountable way .
and should they even want to be ?
this argument , made by the Bundesbank , seems to support a wealth tax .
capitalist competition erodes monopoly profits , whereas public policy risks creating entrenched privilege .
for them , it was second-rate bla@@ ther , nowhere near as worthy of their attention as the cherished series from their child@@ hoods , such as The Ch@@ ron@@ ic@@ les of N@@ ar@@ nia or The Lord of the R@@ ings .
ensuring the availability of trained health workers or counselors to answer patients &quot; questions about their treatment or related issues like insurance could also help .
a private testing laboratory , Con@@ sumer@@ Lab@@ .com , found that hardly any of the &quot; vitamin waters &quot; it tested contained what their labels said they did , and some had only 20 % to 50 % of the amounts of nutrients listed .
effective global cooperation requires much more .
the process the I@@ ARC uses in coming to conclusions is not only scientifically wrong ; it is harmful .
with over a million copies in print , the manual is known as the bi@@ ble of American psychiatry ; certainly it is an invoked chapter and verse in schools , prisons , courts , and by mental-health professionals around the world .
none of this facilitates the political reconciliation and national unity that Egypt needs to complete the most difficult of all revolutionary pivot@@ s : from dismantling an oppressive past to building a better future .
research has shown that so-called tier one capital ratios above 13 % cut the risk of banking collapses sharply .
this is also an occasion to honor the survivors , by supporting their call to eliminate all nuclear weapons , thereby ensuring that no one will ever suffer as they have .
in 1907 , the longest span in the world was being constructed over the St. Lawrence River near Que@@ be@@ c , Canada .
Eichengreen , like me , gl@@ ories in the complexities of every situation , avoiding oversimplification in the pursuit of conceptual clarity .
around the world , donors are cutting development aid to middle-income countries while domestic health-care spending costs are increasing .
for now , I share the excitement of many that a new tool to tackle HIV may be on the horizon .
the old Netherlands , it seems , has ceased to be , never to return .
but , while the number of killings may , indeed , have fallen , does that mean Iraq is really safer ?
Hong Kong is becoming a hub of international finance and services , while Mac@@ au establishes itself as a global gambling and entertainment center .
fundamentally , Hong Kong &apos;s prospects depend on the implementation of the &quot; one country , two systems &quot; principle , conceived by Deng Xiaoping to serve as the basis for Hong Kong &apos;s eventual return to China in 1997 .
in April 2004 , China &apos;s legislators ruled out universal suffrage in Hong Kong &apos;s 2007 election of its chief executive , as well as for its 2008 Legislative Council election .
as soon as those activists begin demanding independence , however , they risk spl@@ inter@@ ing their support and losing the moral high ground that they gained with their campaign in 2014 .
it was not simply humanitarian rage that galvanized so many people in Hong Kong to act in 1989 .
they are comfortable with protracted uncertainty about who is right even in bitter debates , conceding gaps in their knowledge and granting legitimacy to opposing views .
it is difficult to justify the delegation of the inflation target itself to unelected technocrats .
the classical liberal free-trade argument about the universal economic benefits of greater commerce and open markets proved to be unambiguously correct .
Germany certainly became assertive , owing mostly to the social pressures and tensions incited by rapid economic growth .
the greatest danger is that humanitarian relief will be tailored to meet donors &quot; demands , rather than actual needs .
Turkey &apos;s central bank may need to raise interest rates , despite Erdoğan &apos;s deep aversion to such a move .
his circle is packed with y@@ es-@@ men ( and some token y@@ es-@@ women ) , who strive to satisfy his sense of om@@ n@@ is@@ ci@@ ence and magnific@@ ence .
for various reasons , savers have become ascendant across many regions .
Egypt &apos;s government has welcomed Iranian diplomats and embraced the Palestinian group Hamas .
neo-conservative pundits drew the conclusion that the United States was so powerful that it could do whatever it wanted , and that others had no choice but to follow .
this heats the bitumen , making it run@@ ny enough to be pumped out .
Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orbán has reversed a post-communist success story with a sharp turn toward illiberalism .
and those who lose their jobs to the new technology will soon find other employment .
the changes in technology will increase the economy &apos;s output and raise the potential standard of living of the population .
a Health@@ ier Global Health Agenda
at first sight , these fears appear to have been well founded .
it is not . if you want to join the UK Conservative Party or the German Christian Democrats or America &apos;s Democratic Party , you can do so easily , and they will welcome you with open arms .
so you can rightly criticize the actions or overreactions of Egypt &apos;s new military government ; but it is difficult to criticize the intervention that brought it into being .
the rating agencies have long placed Greek debt deep in junk territory , and are now giving Portuguese and Irish debt the same status .
the Islamic State has exploited long-standing Sunni grievances to challenge the territorial integrity of Iraq and Syria , creating a strategic vacuum in which Russia , Iran , the United States , Turkey , and Saudi Arabia now vi@@ e for power , sometimes through proxies , but increasingly through direct military intervention .
whatever the cause of the current low household saving rate , it is a serious problem that requires political action .
nevertheless , presumably we make resolutions because we have decided that it would be best to do whatever it is that we are resolving to do .
Aristotle took a different view , one that fits better with our everyday experience of failing to do what we know to be best .
how will it enforce the rules ?
in countries with a democratic history , it is easy to assume that &quot; it could never happen here , &quot; because &quot; our institutions are too strong , &quot; or &quot; our people love freedom too much , &quot; or they are &quot; too civilized &quot; or &quot; too modern &quot; to slide into barbarism .
it is fairly safe to predict that learning in a knowledge-intensive society will continue at a heightened pace , both at the workplace and outside of it . it will be facilitated through We@@ b-@@ based social software , through wi@@ k@@ is , blogs , and similar developments as much as through new , &quot; open source &quot; business models .
nor is this pressure confined to the United States .
first , the population must comprise individuals with varying characteristics , or traits .
but the increase in quality of life has not been as dramatic .
the purpose of the amic@@ us curi@@ ae is to improve the quality and legitimacy of the judicial process .
one way to instill individual responsibility would be in the form of a personal declaration .
to achieve such high levels of cognitive functioning requires not just cultural intelligence , but also cumulative culture , in which modifications accumulate over time .
my short speech on Hungarian television attracted more than a million viewers , and social media platforms were flooded with out@@ p@@ our@@ ings of sympathy and support .
in China , switching to climate-friendly refriger@@ ants and boosting the energy efficiency of air conditioning and refrigeration could lead to the equivalent in emissions savings of eight Three Gor@@ ges hydroelectric dams .
previously , that threshold was a direct Russian military invasion ; now , as Merkel explained , if Russia disrup@@ ts Ukraine &apos;s May 25 elections , &quot; further sanctions will be unavoidable . &quot;
and , by pushing NATO as far as the Russian borders , the West has hardly been sensitive to Russian security concerns .
after all , those tensions were largely the result of colonial divide-and-rule policies .
territorial disputes over unimportant islands could be laid to rest .
hence , most ICOs deny investors any legal rights whatsoever .
as a result , his administration has been using executive orders to roll back many of the regulations that former US President Barack Obama introduced .
Netanyahu prefers Trump &apos;s crude charlat@@ anism to Obama &apos;s profess@@ orial liberalism .
whereas the West lost no time in imposing sanctions on President Vladimir Putin &apos;s Russia following its annexation of Crimea , it has not punished Israel &apos;s occupation of Palestinian lands .
the drop in oil prices after the mid-1980 &quot; s is said to be due to the collapse of the OPEC oil cartel .
but the Bank of England &apos;s direct intervention prevented these images from gaining a foothold on our collective psychology .
having compromised , the IMF should now stick to its guns and refuse to make its arrangement for Greece operational until it is satisfied on both debt relief and technical assumptions .
in Greece , the IMF , together with its European partners , required the government not just to cut expenditures , but to undertake far-reaching tax , pension , judicial , and labor-market reforms .
after the US stymied their demands for a greater say within the Fund , they now find that the organization has been doing Europe &apos;s bidding .
for the first time , IMF statisticians have compiled a comprehensive set of calculations of both public and private debt , country by country , constructing a time series stretching back to the end of World War II .
economics has certainly played a part in the upsurge of identity politics , but the crisis of identity will not be exp@@ un@@ ged by economic reforms alone .
the scale of that opportunity is huge .
in 2014 , Germany experienced an unprecedented net inflow of 30@@ 4,000 people from other EU countries , and the number was probably similar in 2015 .
in such cases , countries can act as welfare mag@@ nets , attracting many more migrants than would be economically advisable , because the newcomers receive , in addition to their wages , a migration grant in the form of public transfers .
that &apos;s why Cameron is demanding a limitation of the inclusion principle , even for intra-European economic migrants .
this would lower the benefits &quot; net costs and weaken incentives to migrate .
the few polio cases that have been detected have been either cross-border trans@@ missions from Pakistan or have occurred in areas where intense conflict between the Taliban and the Afghan government has temporarily disrupted polio campaigns .
in fact , providing high-quality care that engages and instruc@@ ts children in their first five years of life has a greater impact on their development than any other intervention over the course of their lifetime .
consider Kenya &apos;s M-@@ K@@ O@@ PA , a company that inst@@ alls solar power k@@ its and collects payments via mobile phones .
the participating companies decided that it was in their collective interest to create a single national platform for mobile payments , and they worked with the government and four telecommunications companies to construct one .
this both reflects and reinforces weakness in three areas : self-esteem , risk awareness , and the capacity for action .
the territory being exchanged comprises lawless enclaves , where the nominal sovereign lacks real authority .
India will be the land of Big Data .
if the BJP is to avoid doing further damage to the Indian nation , it must recognize that the past is not a blunt tool for scoring petty political points .
but since the victory of the Hindu@@ -@@ chauvinist BJP in the 2014 general election , a wave of religious triumphalism has swept India , bringing with it not just new cow@@ -@@ protection laws , but also vocifer@@ ous demands for their strict enforcement .
O@@ ck@@ hi has starkly demonstrated that all is not well for India &apos;s fisher@@ folk .
this is normally a secondary objective , but it may become central if the economy enters a low-inflation credit and asset-price boom .
given that the one government the Pakistani Taliban hate more than Pakistan &apos;s is India &apos;s , the idea that they were doing India &apos;s bidding on Pakistani soil is both grotesque and fat@@ uous .
support for the BJP was so strong , in fact , that the party became the first in 30 years to win a majority in the L@@ ok S@@ abh@@ a ( the lower house of India &apos;s parliament ) .
fortunately for India &apos;s citizens , Prime Minister Narendra Modi intends to change that .
even with low prices for devices and data plans relative to the rest of the world , Internet access in India remains beyond the grasp of close to a billion people .
last February , Modi again initiated a thaw , calling Sharif to wish his country luck in the C@@ ric@@ ket World Cup , and dispat@@ ching his foreign secretary to Islamabad .
many rural Indians withering under the heat now see urban migration as their best option .
still , there are things that Indian authorities can do to protect the poor during heat waves .
I am frustrated by the impotence of my government in Mumbai and Delhi , t@@ one-@@ deaf to the anguish of my fellow citizens .
the grand old Taj deserves all the business it is getting , after being the target of a terrorist attack in 2008 . the bravery of the staff in trying to protect the hotel &apos;s clients deserves the applause of every world traveler .
this may well be the most important result of the Indian election : five more years of political stability and economic reform will create an irreversible and virtuous cycle of economic growth and political moderation .
Indians , sick@@ ened by this perf@@ id@@ y , found themselves mourning again in September , when another cross-border assault killed 18 soldiers at an Army base in U@@ ri .
Ch@@ id@@ am@@ bar@@ am &apos;s 2004 / 2005 budget puts those fears to rest .
the key , however , is that the budget does not rely simply on &quot; trickle-down &quot; economics to raise living standards .
but policymakers did not take his proposal seriously .
for all of its benefits , however , rapid urbanization also poses enormous challenges , from managing congestion and pollution to ensuring that growth is inclusive and equitable .
for fairness as well as for efficiency reasons , rights and benefits should be attached to individuals , not to companies or employment status , and should be fully portable across sectors and jobs .
this pits farmers and animal-@@ feed producers against one another in a fierce competition over land .
this May , in M@@ ap@@ u@@ to , Mozambique , I delivered the United Nations University &apos;s annual W@@ ID@@ ER lecture on development .
is that the choice we have to make then : freedom or equality ?
but alternatives that would have made the South richer at the price of reducing the wealth of the North would require a wholesale revolution in human psychology .
but what does that mean , and where is the revolution taking us ?
higher real interest rates , in turn , depress business investment and residential construction .
the ECB , in particular , now has little choice but to continue its expansionary policies , including QE , until it sees some sustained increase in inflation .
this will help to prevent government guarantees for public-private partnerships from imposing budgetary costs equivalent to one or more points of GDP , as has happened in Colombia , Indonesia , and Portugal .
whether it &apos;s in the Beirut Digital District or the Gr@@ E@@ E@@ K campus in Cairo , some of the Middle East &apos;s brightest minds are turning innovative ideas into marketable products .
in a region that has struggled to find its economic footing since the Arab Spring , the entrepreneurial ideas being refined at incub@@ ators like these hold the keys to the region &apos;s future .
gender bias , too , is a limiting factor ; nearly every MENA economy fails to empower female employees and executives fully .
addressing both challenges would help cash-strapped startups make every dollar count .
but there is a solid foundation of rationality on which to build in keeping the door open for negotiations .
smart diplomacy has also helped .
adequate private insurance can be boosted in the future through public education , improved insurance institutions , and lower insurance costs .
since Katrina , issuance has accelerated .
we show that the preponderance of theoretical and empirical evidence indicates that the economic institutions and laws protecting knowledge in today &apos;s advanced economies are increasingly inadequate to govern global economic activity , and are poorly suited to meet the needs of developing countries and emerging markets .
indeed , once established , a monopoly can use its market power to squ@@ el@@ ch competitors , as Microsoft so amply demonstrated in the case of the Net@@ s@@ cape Web brow@@ ser .
but we need a system with teeth .
nonetheless , some institutions , both formal and informal , already govern the basic functioning of the Internet .
attempting to use game theory to interpret the various calls for coordination is revealing , though not in the way that game theorists assume .
long before Russia &apos;s armed annexation of Crimea and its invasion of eastern Ukraine , the Kremlin played similar games when it engineered the secession of Georgia &apos;s South Ossetia and Abkhazia regions and propped up the ban@@ dit territory of Tran@@ sn@@ ist@@ ria in Moldova .
that is the purpose of the Internet Bar@@ ri@@ ers Index .
telemedicine applications will allow physicians to treat patients who are hundreds of miles away .
and they made no attempt to monetize their efforts until long after users were ho@@ oked .
we can only assume , given wars and other uncertainties , that true market prices back then , like today , were quite volatile .
third , intervention planners should assume worst-case rather than best-case scenarios .
yet half of the world &apos;s children live in areas where the pneumococcal vaccine is not available through a national immunization program , and only 15 % of the children in the world &apos;s poorest countries have access to the rotavirus vaccine .
when the Soviet Union successfully launched Sputnik 1 , the world &apos;s first man-made satellite , on October 4 , 1957 , the achievement sent shock waves through the US government , which responded with huge investments in rocket technology , research , and education .
determining exactly how much efficiency should be sacrificed , and in which cases , is never easy .
this argument has been ignored .
that is why he placed a high priority on reaching a deal with the outside world that would close the nuclear file and pave the road to economic recovery .
on this basis , Rouhani &apos;s coalition of reformists and pragmatists easily wins a majority when Iran &apos;s next parliament is elected in 2016 , with Rouhani himself re-elected in 2017 .
the EU oil sanctions , for example , could be suspended almost immediately if an agreement were reached .
this will not be easy ; indeed , it is no exaggeration to predict that the effort to generate such confidence may well prove as demanding as the negotiations themselves .
in some of his statements , and in his recent interview with Thomas Friedman of the New York Times , Obama compared the deal with Iran to Richard Nixon &apos;s opening to China in 1972 .
Iran &apos;s leaders might be ready to let their people &quot; eat grass and even go hungry &quot; for the sake of their nuclear ambitions , but Iran &apos;s squeezed middle class , one hopes , will not submit to such degradation .
at a time when the Islamic Republic has failed in its economic and political promises to the Iranian people , the regime &apos;s most glaring weakness may prove to be the absence of a credible religious authority that can justify its shortcomings .
thus , the first slogan of the opposition invoked the religious credo of the 1979 revolutionaries .
much of the world , though , is un@@ sympathetic , and statehood in today &apos;s world depends on recognition by other states .
for one thing , the September 11 attacks were by a human enemy , and despite inadequate domestic preparations for such an event , Americans &quot; anger was directed outward .
many people around the world are indulging in what the Germans call &quot; schadenfreude &quot; : pleasure at the suffering of others .
day or night , they live in darkness .
needing nothing more than food , decent housing , and the possibility of a job , these families wait for death , dre@@ ading the cries of their starving children .
a similar situation is evident in Iraq today .
but the most powerful alternative to the status quo are powerful Islamist opposition movements that have no real answers for these ailments and merely seek to impose another flavor of dictatorship .
January &apos;s Palestinian elections were won by a relatively moderate leader because he was put forward by the ruling Fatah movement and Islamists boycotted the election .
the Iraqi refugees are a crisis that cannot be ignored : the international community must alleviate the burden on the countries in the region , while offering resettlement opportunities to many more of the most vulnerable Iraqis .
in short , universities prove their worth if students find it easier to appropriate academic knowledge than the academics themselves originally did .
once a country eliminated convertibility into gold , it was free to pursue monetary expansion , and deflation tended to end .
many of America &apos;s post-World War II recessions were caused by the Fed hiking interest rates too fast and too far .
macroeconomic policy can never be devoid of politics : it involves fundamental trade-offs and affects different groups differently .
these are fairly ritu@@ alistic issues , and Chinese officials are smart enough to know that , given the Chinese government &apos;s recent behavior , Obama had little choice but to decide on them as he did .
China &apos;s size and high rate of economic growth will almost certainly increase its relative strength vis-à-vis the US in the coming decades .
fortunately , people also tend to trust their national leaders .
the confident side of the Chinese leadership &apos;s split personality is easy to understand .
Re@@ introducing the national currency in order to depreciate it , but leaving the euro value of other financial instruments untouched , would destroy balance sheets and wreak financial havoc .
in these two countries , lower housing prices are likely to be associated with a sharp and prolonged drop in domestic demand , which should be stronger even than what can be expected in the US .
we are interested in what the multiplier is under more normal conditions , and when the unemployment rate is 10 % .
what lies ahead is uncertain ; the Economic Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean stressed that CAFTA &apos;s implementation will add 0.5 percentage points to the rate of annual GDP growth in the region .
but this situation has deteriorated recently , for two reasons . first , the total volume of JGBs has become extremely high relative to households &quot; net monetary assets , which stand at roughly ¥ 1,@@ 100 trillion .
Islamic radicals enjoy enough support to be a serious threat in their part of the world .
notably , the business sector is asked to take a more active role to reduce its carbon footprint , commit to 100 % renewable energy and zero emissions , shift investments into renewable energy , adopt more sustainable business models , and assist in the divestment from fossil fuels .
if people are to have full confidence in Islamic financial products , moreover , the industry will need to be standardized and regulated .
national tax policies will also need to be t@@ weak@@ ed , to prevent discrimination against Islamic financial instruments .
but the risk-sharing inherent to Islamic finance made such instruments more resistant to the first round of financial contagion that hit in 2008 .
thus , external interventions like the vaccination program are viewed as a stalking horse for deeper government encroachment into Pashtun areas .
at least 85 sharia courts are now operating in Britain &apos;s parallel Muslim society , while the number of mosques ( 1,6@@ 89 ) now almost equals the number of Ang@@ li@@ can churches that have recently closed ( 1,@@ 700 ) .
the deposits can be individuals &quot; paychecks and the loans can be to small businesses .
then came the terrorist attacks of September 11 , 2001 .
given the inherent tension implied by neo-conservatism &apos;s simultaneous embrace of secular free-market capitalism and &quot; traditional &quot; values , its strategy , perfected since the Reagan era , has been to re-@@ draw the lines of division : then , as now , the West is &quot; at risk , &quot; which requires nurturing a strongly emotional distinction between &quot; us &quot; and &quot; them . &quot;
they would share Jerusalem as a capital , and find a mutually acceptable solution to the enormously sensitive issue of the return of Palestinian refugees .
that , rather than sla@@ king the public &apos;s thirst for vengeance , should be their primary objective .
against this backdrop , it is easier to defend the status quo than to advocate accommodation involving territorial concessions .
neither Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe , who visited Israel a few weeks after his reelection in December 2014 , nor the leaders of China , now Israel &apos;s third-largest trading partner , bother to link their economic ties with Israel to the success of peace talks with the Palestinians .
moreover , the two problems are hardly related .
it is a world in which mono@@ the@@ istic rivalries will be diluted in an ocean of poly@@ the@@ ist faiths , and in which Israel will be able to depend only on its comparative merits in the eyes of cynical , realistic actors who will judge it solely on the basis of their own national interests .
my view is that the Asian financial centers have it right .
it &apos;s wrong to write Russia off as fundamentally different from the West .
Malta , too , has a deficit close to 10 % of GDP , up four percentage points since 2001 .
a pro-EU Italy governed by an M5@@ S-@@ Democrat coalition could join with France and Germany to reform the EU ; regain a clear foreign-policy voice for EU vis-à-vis the US , Russia , and China ; and implement a strategy for green , innovation-@@ based growth .
as a result , a major recapitalization of Italian banks and the creation of a &quot; bad bank &quot; to absorb NPLs were deemed unnecessary .
For@@ za Itali@@ a is polling at around 16 % , which is slightly higher than the Northern League &apos;s support , even if it is well below the party &apos;s heyday , when it polled above 25 % .
to counter these factors , Italy is resorting to fiscal policy to try to stimulate growth through both demand and supply channels .
there are rumors that the parties want to write down Italy &apos;s sovereign debt , which currently stands at a relatively stable level of just over 130 % of GDP .
and others are no doubt aware that Italian governments tend to come and go rather frequently , and that the economy and society have rarely suffered undue disruptions as a result .
and they are probably right that a reasser@@ tion of greater sovereignty over the key flows of globalization is necessary to counter the centrifugal political , social , and technological forces sweeping across advanced countries .
moreover , P@@ ado@@ an , who was formerly the OECD &apos;s chief economist , is the only G-7 finance minister with professional economics training .
but even with more effective leaders , Italy would have faced EU headwinds .
the result is a domin@@ o effect , which has become the main threat to the future of the euro and the EU .
it is a game that does not always end well .
Ki@@ yosaki may try too hard to be inspirational , but I often think of him when I hear finance professors op@@ ine on the efficiency of markets and the futility of making money by trading in them .
he also has invested in non-traditional asset classes , including real estate , oil , timber , private equity , and venture capital and buy@@ out firms .
Madison expected elected representatives to look outward , assessing the people &apos;s interests and drawing on their knowledge and ideas .
Jordan has more than 600,000 registered refugees , and a similar number who are un@@ registered ; it expects a half-million more this year .
but just where , exactly , should it be drawn ?
in fact , the reinterpretation amounts to little more than a tweak : Japanese forces can now shield an American warship defending Japan , but they remain prohibited from initiating offensive attacks or participating in multilateral military operations .
&quot; the weight of a human life , &quot; he declared , &quot; is heavier than the earth itself . &quot;
excessive government debt can be highly damaging .
on the contrary , it promises more asset bubbles , financial crises , and Japanese-@@ style secular stagnation .
from the moment the DPJ took power in 2009 , Kan was tacitly sl@@ ated to be Hatoyama &apos;s successor , given that he was con@@ currently Hatoyama &apos;s deputy prime minister and treasury minister .
the efforts of Kan &apos;s government are obviously hampered by a rigid and much fragmented bureaucratic infrastructure .
but , even as the US withdraws its infan@@ try , it cannot ignore the threat that Islamist terror poses to America .
that is why the US will increasingly depend on countries like India to ensure the success of its global anti-terror policy .
perhaps the clearest indication of the party &apos;s decline occurred in December , when it suffered crushing defeats in four key state-@@ assembly elections .
Manmohan Singh &apos;s decade of disastrous leadership has been characterized by weakness and decay .
this imperative is one of the factors linking India and Japan .
advances in the defense industry lead to significant positive externalities , such as civil-@@ military synergies and investment in research and development , which is fundamental to growth , innovation , and future competitiveness .
even so , the shale revolution across the Atlantic has been felt in diverse ways .
and , here , Europe &apos;s vision should center on the challenges confronting its three neighboring regions .
following Russia &apos;s illegal annexation of Crimea , and further Russian revanchism in eastern Ukraine , relations with Putin &apos;s Kremlin need to be reconsidered .
a window of opportunity to reach agreement on Iran &apos;s nuclear program appears to have opened .
within weeks , the popular revolt triggered by Bou@@ az@@ izi &apos;s act had spread far beyond Tunisia , engulfing much of the Arab world .
today , the North Atlantic economy faces two additional downward shocks .
those of us who fear that the Fed &apos;s approach has greatly deepened the US economy &apos;s malaise and is turning America &apos;s cyclical unemployment into permanent long-term structural non-@@ employment have lost the domestic monetary-policy argument .
one would think that America &apos;s leaders would be clam@@ bering to formulate policies aimed at returning the economy to its pre-2008 growth path : putting people back to work , cleaning up underwater mortgages , restoring financial markets &quot; risk-bearing capacity , and boosting investment .
the politician who can figure out how to steer the revolution accordingly might never lose another election .
and Japanese politics entrenched rural and small-@@ business interests in a way that impeded the diffusion of export-oriented manufacturing .
but from the perspective of the past seven years , this clearly needs to be rethought .
more generally , regulatory clarity and predictability are essential to private investment .
the Scottish pro-independence campaign is based on four claims .
new antiretroviral medicines had been developed and were being used in rich countries , but were too expensive for the poorest .

this would allow a rapid public-health response that is commensurate to the immediate challenge .
the SDSN mobilizes scientific and technical expertise from academia , civil society , and the private sector in support of sustainable-development problem solving at local , national , and global scales .
these are mainly engineering problems , not negotiating problems .
and yet many Americans are persuaded to support such policies , not because it is in their interest , but because they do not understand the economics .
Krugman &apos;s presentation at the IMF conference was as surprising as the others : concerns about US fiscal deficits and debt are misplaced even in the longer term .
what defines good leadership is a notoriously complicated question .
such leaders &quot; personalities may have changed .
the government would like to keep its subsidies and stockpiles .
ideally , other , more efficient means of supporting incomes at the bottom will be instituted at the same time that food and energy subsidies are cut .
from the viewpoint of multinational corporations , how big is the Chinese market ?
Jeremy Lin and the Political Economy of Super@@ stars
Lin &apos;s success is delicious , partly because it contradicts so many cultural prejudices about A@@ sian-@@ American athletes .
much anxiety is directed toward growing demand for meat and dairy products in China and India .

I have not mentioned the elephant in the room : the threat to the Fed &apos;s independence posed by a president seemingly intent on challenging all institutional norms .
and there are an estimated 200,000 cases of yellow fever annually , leading to 30,000 deaths worldwide .
the World Health Organization &apos;s Special Program for Research and Tra@@ ining in Tro@@ pical Diseases has called upon regulatory agencies to emphasize &quot; science-based , case-by-case targeted requirements with a degree of practical parsi@@ mony , &quot; instead of relying on &quot; a precautionary approach that can require data to address all theoretical risks . &quot;
maybe the global economy will perform a little better in 2014 than it did in 2013 , or maybe not .
for developed and developing countries alike , the new demands cannot be met if health care continues to operate in the same way .
United Nations reports of atrocities , Internet images of attacks on civilians , and accounts of suffering refugees ren@@ d our hearts .
it does not help that some Korean and Chinese leaders have used anti-Japanese rhetoric to win domestic support .
decline is a misleading metaphor for today &apos;s America , and Obama fortunately has rejected the suggestion that he should pursue a strategy aimed at managing it .
of course , it is understandable that Western banks that recklessly extended euro loans to these countries now want to give them euro printing presses .
it is also remarkable that Juncker managed to get Trump to emphasize working with the World Trade Organization to resolve issues regarding intellectual property rights .
Europe could have allowed a common social model to develop alongside economic integration .

by contrast , E@@ room &apos;s law charts the regress in new drug appro@@ vals , noting that the costs of developing a new medicine double roughly every nine years .
for countries that lack China &apos;s strong fiscal position , the need to attract private capital to infrastructure investment is obvious .
taxation remains the dominant source of government revenue in most developed countries .
the original swap lines might fairly be classified as emergency measures .

and Japan is trying to combat two decades of deflation with aggressive and unconventional monetary policies .
the problem is that the policy has also caused the yen to depreciate , leading nearby countries to accuse Japan of adopting &quot; beggar-thy-neighbor &quot; policies .

but , more than 50 years ago , the Nobel laureate Paul Samuelson contradic@@ ted this ide@@ alization of markets in graphic terms : absolute freedom for the market will lead to Roc@@ kefeller &apos;s dog getting the milk that a poor child needs for healthy development , not because of market failure , but because &quot; goods are placed in the hands of those who pay the most for them . &quot;
second , the White House must not only get the pending free trade agreements ratified by Congress , but should improve them , learning from the NAFTA experience , make them more poverty-@@ sensitive , more environment@@ all@@ y- and labor-@@ oriented , and provide more support for infrastructure and training .
on the contrary , it has plenty of both .
policymakers must periodically reassess their efforts and promptly abandon failures .
perhaps the best evidence that this is not an ideolo@@ g@@ ic@@ ally-@@ driven sea change is to be found in what triggered it : an economic downturn .
the resulting boost to aggregate demand would then buttress the case for the Federal Reserve to raise short-term interest rates faster than it had been planning to do .
according to standard economic theory , real wages should track productivity .
accordingly , public- and private-sector leaders should look for ways to help those who feel frustrated and left behind economically or socially .

this diagnosis seems to misread the historical evidence from the period between the early 1970s and the late 1990s , and is thus based on a fundamentally flawed assumption about the primary driver of inflation in the global North since World War II .
the energy component of the CPI fell over the last 12 months by 19 % .
and when economists confront a fundamental question , fundamental disagreement often follows .
from the 1970s to the late 2000s , demography was essentially a dormant issue .

before Poland decides to share a currency with its main trading partners , it should consider three vital economic conditions : its international competitiveness , the flexibility of its labor market , and the health of its public finances .
in the longer run , flexible labor markets also increase structural unemployment and fuel the informal economy .

the fundamental problem is well known : major banks have significant incentives to take on excessive risk .
they also hope that the guarantees would motivate the bondholders to monitor banks &quot; activities and pressure bank managers to limit their risky operations .
it would recommend policies for eliminating imbalances and describe what kind of exchange-rate and reserve changes must accompany any adjustments .
and focusing the favorable tax treatment on such major risk insurance would reduce the wasteful distortion to spend more on minor health conditions that do not stimulate household saving and do not need insurance protection .
to date , China has been silent about the implications of the San Francisco Treaty for its claims in the South China Sea .
until this last part , the scenario probably felt all too current for many readers , a large number of whom are still adjusting to the reality of Donald Trump &apos;s presidency .
unfortunately , we found that progress toward other goals has been less impressive .

powerful technological and global market forces are not confined to any single country .
it is clearly necessary to implement credible plans to arrest the growth of these liabilities .
in other words , unlike the preceding wave of digital technology , which motivated firms to gain access to and deploy underutilized pools of valuable labor around the world , the driving force in this round is cost reduction via the replacement of labor .

even if all of this is achieved , a truly sustainable solution to the refugee crisis will not come until Syria is at peace , and order is restored in failing states across the Middle East .
such a scenario might appear to be a distant dream today , given the region &apos;s myriad conflicts .
one way to achieve this is to price water more appropriately , which would create an incentive to prevent wastage and conserve supplies .
that is all the more likely , given mounting domestic pressure for reform from a technologically savvy and globally engaged young citizenry .

America &apos;s founders sought to ensure that individuals serving in high positions of public trust would be well qualified , not just in the judgment of a single individual , but after thoughtful review by an independently elected Senate .
in this context , sending a secret envoy to Pyongyang to lay the groundwork for productive negotiations is precisely what the US should be doing .
a flexible solution like mini-grids is well suited to this context .
Deng and his successors buttressed this trend by granting Chinese citizens considerable personal freedoms , fueling the emergence of a culture of cra@@ ss consumerism and mass entertainment .
of course , it is premature to conclude that JPMorgan violated the US Foreign Cor@@ rup@@ t P@@ rac@@ tices Act by employing children of Chinese officials who oversaw companies that retained the bank to underwrite their stock offerings .

Russian President Vladimir Putin has consistently used the courts to neutralize his opponents .
without functioning democratic institutions , Russia &apos;s second attempt at selective modernization will fail just as certainly as its previous , Soviet incarnation did .
third , with European institutions acting as catalysts , political leaders will need to reinforce efforts to place the eurozone as a whole on a firm footing .
as a result , many companies , less convinced that &quot; normal &quot; innovation yields big payoffs , end up investing less overall than they did before .
some central bankers now worry that ending these measures prematurely will tip the economy back into recession .
we are working on a new Association Agreement , which would anchor Moldova in the European space .
and they cannot eliminate pockets of excessive indebtedness that inhibit new investment and growth .
if policymakers are incorrect in assuming that the positive supply shocks holding down inflation are temporary , policy normalization may be the wrong approach , and unconventional policies should be sustained for longer .
Monnet was a born technocrat , who hated political conflict and almost made a fe@@ tish of unity .

it was a low point in Indo-@@ Pakistan relations , and no one in Delhi was prepared to trust Musharraf ever again .
the judge had refused to be directed by the president and the military in deciding important constitutional matters , including Musharraf &apos;s own eligibility to contest the presidency while still in uniform .
what China does will have almost as much influence as President Obama on the future of the global economy , and Chinese-@@ American relations will be the most important bilateral relationship in the world .
it has adapted the doctrine of harmonious development , which is the right approach , but it also has other doctrines , notably those relating to Taiwan and Tibet , that work in the opposite direction .
in contrast , Brazil &apos;s balanced current account , coupled with its nearly 9 % -of-GDP fiscal deficit , means that Brazilian firms and households must have a surplus of exactly the same 9 % of GDP .

indeed , Namibia provides low-cost health care not only for its own citizens , but also for its neighbors .
no one in Namibia talks about building a wall between their country and its poor and corrupt neighbors .
on economic , financial , tax , trade , and climate issues , many people around the world are fearful or angry , believing that a worldwide cab@@ al of bankers , corporations , and G-20 elites uses insider deals to monopoli@@ ze the benefits of globalization .
the result is that a xenophobic , racist party , one hostile to everything essential to the spirit and greatness of France , was defeated in all of the contests that it was supposed to win .
while globalization has helped to boost overall prosperity , it has been most beneficial for those who form the new global elite .
that is why it is so hard for me to understand their position today .
just a week after Trump &apos;s UN speech , French President Emmanuel Macron presented his vision of Europe &apos;s future in an address at the Sor@@ bon@@ ne .

nineteenth- and twentieth-century European nationalists often regarded the US as the natural home for capitalists and &quot; rootless cosmopolitans &quot; without any loyalty to their native soil .
to our surprise , Sadat told us that he , in fact , had respect for the US .
in the late 1990s , it was estimated that the economic burden of anxiety totaled more than $ 40 billion .
nor is it clear that NATO enlargement was preferable to other security arrangements for Europe that would have included Russia .
most importantly , they inherited from the Soviet era bloated and inefficient public sectors , which they are finding hard to downsize and profession@@ alize .

Egypt , too , needs to focus on easing severe domestic social and political strain .
question 1 : what exactly will the Fed do under its new boss , Janet Yellen ?
because the buy-@@ down is triggered by achievement of a pre-defined target , such transactions promote result@@ s-based financing , bringing about quantifiable reforms that otherwise might not have been realized .

it makes little economic difference to Germany , France , or Italy whether Britain is an EU member or simply in the WTO .
if Britain rejected these encro@@ achments on national sovereignty , its service industries would be locked out of the single market .
second , major firms should keep track of emerging innovators .
companies that lose sight of that are doomed .
North Korea &quot; test of a long range missile may have failed , but that will not relieve regional jit@@ ters .
Roh reportedly also discussed exporting defense materials worth $ 2.3 billion , including training aircraft , destro@@ yers , and armed vehicles .
for example , the sanctions imposed in September 2017 on textiles , coal , and other exports are said to have reduced North Korean exports by 90 % .
the test made explicit what was implicit .
in 1994 , when the US and North Korea last agreed to a freeze on North Korea &apos;s plutonium production , Kim &apos;s father , Kim Jong-il , quickly broke the deal , embarking on a secret uranium program .
North Korea &apos;s nuclear weapons program threatens to upset that balance , by giving its regime the capacity , through the long-range ballistic missiles it is testing , to strike the West Coast of the US , thereby raising a new version of an old question : would the US risk Los Angeles to protect Seoul ?
a crisis could stem from other factors as well : a large increase in the number of nuclear warheads that North Korea produces , evidence that it is selling nuclear materials to terrorist groups , or some use of its conventional military forces against South Korea or US forces stationed there .
Chinese leaders have no love for Kim Jong-un &apos;s regime or its nuclear weapons , but it dis@@ likes even more the prospect of North Korea &apos;s collapse and the unification of the Korean Peninsula with Seoul as the capital .
another possible response to the North Korean threat is tougher international sanctions , including secondary boycotts .
Kim Jong-il preferred military rule , and pushed the army to the forefront .
the global financial crisis has served to show that there is little tolerance nowadays for people who cheat .
though both sides believe they are patriotic Americans , their idea of patriotism could not be more different .
and yet , to focus the Democratic agenda on Trump and diversity would be a mistake .
in Asia , too , nationalism is resurgent .
a year or two ago , six main risks stood at center stage :

they do so with good reason .
Pe@@ uri@@ fo@@ y &apos;s statements have rightly raised concerns about the security of nuclear weapons stockpiled in insecure regions .
yes , many companies took on too much debt , and some countries , such as Korea , are more compromised than others .
of course , no honest discussion of Obama &apos;s presidency can ignore the role of his race .
indeed , by the early 2000s , more than four-fifths of an average North Korean &apos;s household income comprised unofficial earnings from market activities .
but there is another problem with the US taking a leading role in political revolts in the Middle East .
there are no doubt some among the demonstrators who would like Obama to be more strident in his support of their aims .
the deal &apos;s subsequent approval should have been a no-brainer for Congress , as it neither increased America &apos;s financial obligations nor took away its voting dominance .
more recently , the US has re@@ established diplomatic relations with Cuba , ending a 5@@ 5-year policy of isolation that succeeded only in giving Cuba &apos;s leaders an excuse for economic failure and handic@@ apping America &apos;s relationships throughout Latin America .
but they should do so only after having considered all of the facts .
upon taking office , Obama set four objectives in the Middle East : stabilize Iraq before leaving it ; withdraw from Afghanistan from a position of strength and on the basis of minimal political convergence with Pakistan ; achieve a major breakthrough in the Middle East peace process by pushing Israeli Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu to freeze settlements ; and open a dialogue with Iran on the future of its nuclear program .
international agreements regulating the size and composition of national defenses have often been controversial in the Senate .
the A@@ J@@ A embodied some of what Sper@@ ling describes in his book : subsidies for hiring , wage insurance , and job training , as well as support for education and early learning .
indeed , two of the nation &apos;s most respected forecasters predicted that the A@@ J@@ A would add 1.@@ 3-@@ 1.9 million jobs in 2012 and more than two million jobs by the end of 2013 .
such grants between 2009 and 2011 , totaling $ 130 billion , helped states to maintain vital services and retain the public employees providing them .
having said this , there would be immediate upside potential , owing to better resource allocation , more harmonized investment regimes , stronger standards , and the elimination of outdated non-tariff and regulatory barriers .
but flexible exchange rates are still the right way for the region to develop a more balanced economic and financial base .
Saudi Arabia correctly reasoned that cutting output would not boost prices , but simply concede space for new players to step in and grab market share .
until last summer , oil operated under a monopoly price regime , because Saudi Arabia became a &quot; swing producer , &quot; restricting supply whenever it exceeded demand .
other regions , however , are likely to be unable to provide productive employment .
President Bachelet would like to solve the century-@@ old problem of landlocked Bolivia &apos;s access to the Pacific , but she is finding this task to be trickier than expected , as Morales increases gas prices and reduces gas exports to Argentina , Chile &apos;s largest foreign supplier of energy .
sometimes , poor countries are priced out of a sport .
on the contrary , China is finding itself under intense international scrutiny for everything from its policy toward Tibet , human rights , and product safety to the level of its currency , its policy in Sudan , and global climate change . what was meant to be a moment of celebration has turned into one of criticism .
but this approach is far less practic@@ able , and thus less credible .
the heavy artillery of monetary and fiscal stimulus is being wasted on attempts to short-@@ circuit balance-sheet repair .
the problems stem from the fact that today &apos;s labor markets provide crude , incomplete , and geographically restricted signals about the skills that actually are in demand .
then there are cases where the motivation for censorship is unclear .
now , OPEC is just a toothless zombie , attracting attention , but without having any impact on the living .
that would impose high costs , because the small size of the domestic market would prevent them from achieving economies of scale in technology , product development , and manufacturing .
it has been 150 years since the &quot; black ships &quot; of America &apos;s Navy forcibly opened up Japan .
moreover , these benefits would be realized not only by pharmaceutical companies , but also by academics and other collaborators .
while technology is no panacea , when pa@@ ired with wise policy reforms , it can make a meaningful contribution to the fight for good governance .
how could he profess such views as the leader of a European Union member state , even as he stuffed his government &apos;s coffers with EU subsidies ?
if we want the &quot; peace on earth and mercy mild &quot; promised in our Christmas car@@ ols , we will need to work much harder and more confidently to secure them .

&quot; big corporations don &apos;t even have Africa on the map when they consider outsourcing locations , &quot; says Sam@@ bo@@ u M@@ ak@@ alo@@ u , a native of Mali who tries to persuade US employers to shift service jobs to Africa .
thirty years later , Jimmy Carter still spoke bitterly about an incident at the Democrats &quot; convention in 1980 .
the good news is that India &apos;s Supreme Court has an exemplary record of interpreting statu@@ tes in a way that expands human rights in the country .
both of these theories can be connected with Piketty &apos;s arguments about the dynamics of capital accumulation .
an integrated network of driverless , electric vehicles that are connected , coordinated , and shared should form the core of that solution .

carbon-dioxide emissions from forest clearing and burning account for nearly 10 % of global emissions .
industrialized countries , such as the United States and the members of the European Union , bear a special responsibility for providing solutions to the problem of deforestation .

hence , the big question underlying the current wave of liberalization is whether these reform tendencies are politically sustainable .
a credible , pre-announced phase-out path would provide much-needed reassurance to sk@@ it@@ tish global investors , without imposing immediate hardship on the poor .
when the economic slowdown hast@@ ened the relocation of many manufacturers to inland provinces or neighboring countries , those in the coastal regions began to call for increased openness , deeper structural reforms , and industrial upgrading .
in almost all of the rich-country proposals about targets , limits , commitments , and permits for greenhouse gases , there is hardly a word about helping poor countries to finance the transition to sustainable technologies .
the current political turmoil in Europe shows that , regardless of how sensible Chancellor Angela Merkel &apos;s austerity prescriptions for debt-ridden peripheral Europe might be in the abstract , they resemble a German D@@ ik@@ tat .
there is indeed something wrong with today &apos;s interest rates .
unfortunately , strong vested interests have spent millions of dollars on spreading misinformation about climate change .
in fact , as Prime Minister David Cameron recently explained , his government seeks to renegotiate the terms of its EU membership , and to hold a referendum on the outcome , which potentially would decide whether the UK remains an EU member .
but this might not be achieved without involving the major regional stakeholders , including Pakistan , China , and possibly Iran .
the macroeconomic outcomes have consistently fallen short of expectations , and there is reason to believe that it will be even more difficult in Japan for monetary policy alone to gain sufficient traction .
a year later , where are we ?
in the meantime , Sharon has paid heavily for his policies .
the advantages of pooling sovereignty and resources ring increasingly hollow to ordinary Europeans .
if only those member states who claim to be the UN &apos;s biggest supporters put their money where their mouths are .
in American domestic politics , these kinds of commands from the US Congress to states are known as &quot; unfunded mandates ; &quot; ordering results without providing the resources necessary to achieve them .
homes and livelihoods have been destroyed .
but sometimes their preparatory work requires decisions to be taken at the ministerial level , or even by heads of state or government . this was the case in Kyoto in 1997 , and again in Copenhagen at COP15 .

both countries face formidable resistance to reform from formidable vested interests and lobby groups .
beyond the issue of money , there is the problem of a system of checks and balances run amok , leading to governmental paralysis .
he thought that it was important to confront the fact of our insignificant place in the universe , because he did not want us to live under the illusory comfort of a belief that somehow the world had been created for our sake , and that we are under the benevolent care of an all-powerful cre@@ ator .
but that is not our problem now . sufficient un@@ to the day is the evil there@@ of .
the post-Soviet economy crumbled , crime skyrocketed , and life expectancy declined . Russia &apos;s voice in global affairs lost authority .

this week &apos;s gathering in Poznan is an important step .
the Japanese typically try to keep quiet .
the P@@ ec@@ ora Commission hearings were sensational , but it is difficult to argue that the public anger they whipped up was much greater than that which greeted Wall Street &apos;s titans when they testified before the Financial Crisis In@@ quiry Commission in 2010 .
but this ignores the fact that Steagall was not enamored of more extensive bran@@ ching , which disadvantaged small banks .
instead , a number of European countries are discussing the introduction of stringent fiscal rules into their constitutions , and are contemplating even more far-reaching changes .
it is not clear why Abe and his advisers believe that this will deliver sustained real GDP growth of 2 % a year .
the left-wing party wants to redistribute wealth and incomes more , and the right-wing party less ; but both need to restrain themselves , and in appealing to the median voter , they become near-@@ identical alternatives .
their main political preference then becomes resistance to those external threats .
such taxes surely reduce liquidity in financial markets .
when poor countries consume as much per capita as rich countries , will there be enough oil to go around ?
China and India have been cris@@ scro@@ ssing the globe making financially and politically costly deals to try to lock up the output of new oil-producing countries .
the US uses about 21 million barrels of oil a day , and imports about 2.5 million of it from the Persian Gulf .
he focused on how to organize our activities and use our prosperity to create a world fit for the good life .
so , by the end of the year , let &apos;s set up , with the representatives of the European institutions and the member states , a Conference for Europe in order to propose all the changes our political project needs , with an open mind , even to amending the treaties .
but Americans should be equally concerned that their country &apos;s &quot; exceptionalism &quot; is de@@ generating into &quot; exemp@@ tionalism . &quot;
his approval ratings are historically low for a new president , around 40 % , with roughly 55 % of respondents dis@@ approving .
there is one option that should not be kept on the table : a quick agreement with the North to freeze its nuclear and missile testing in exchange for , say , the suspension of annual US-South Korea joint military exercises .
the US must help these countries build up their infrastructure , educational and legal systems , competitiveness , and transparency .
on the contrary , during the time they waste , the debt grows heavier , not only weakening the debtor &apos;s short-term prospects , but also discouraging inflows of new capital and investments that are critical to future growth .
but the states possessing nuclear weapons have always opposed such a ban , arguing that it would not be credible .
key countries must find the political will to confront defensive interests and negotiate with flexibility to reach a market-@@ opening deal .

now that Europe &apos;s current crisis has convinced many that existing institutional arrangements are unsustainable , this may be about to change .
furthermore , the Spratly Islands dispute should be resolved through international adjudication .
the US will never place a large land army on the Asian mainland again .
this decision followed the banks having passed the so-called &quot; stress tests &quot; of their financial viability , which the US Treasury demanded , and the success of some of them in raising the additional capital that the tests suggested they needed .
economists do not fully understand why expanded trade has produced the negative consequences for wages and employment that it has .
in recent decades , the anti-trade argument has focused largely on &quot; unfair &quot; competition and economic dislocation .
total demand and its growth do matter , but so does market share .
such a scheme , if poorly designed , might deliver excessive protectionism .
if monetary expansion does not merit the charge of currency manipulation , still less do other sorts of economic policies .
but this factor alone demands serious attention , given the single market &apos;s size and close geographic proximity .
yet one important current factor could impede such action : risk-@@ aversion on the part of local officials .
Brown &apos;s fate has far-reaching effects for both Germany and France , because it is seen as the writing on the wall .
to be sure , the TPP might help the US to advance its goal of containing China &apos;s influence in the Asia-Pacific region , exemplified in US President Barack Obama &apos;s declaration that , &quot; With TPP , China does not set the rules in that region ; we do . &quot;
is it treason to question throwing huge sums of money at a policy that will do virtually no good in a hundred years ?
after that , the Chinese agreed to start importing US beef this summer , rescinding protectionist policies that had been in place for several years . China also agreed to open its market to a range of US financial services .
but that is not going to happen .
if Trump actually wants to help those who have been left behind , he must go beyond the ideological battles of the past .
just as uncertain is the future of Afghanistan , where more than a decade of international involvement and assistance has failed to bring about a capable government or quell the Taliban and other armed opposition groups .
Trump , who vacill@@ ates between tough criticism of China over trade and en@@ com@@ i@@ ums to President Xi Jinping , will have to balance pressing his legitimate concerns over trade with the need to avoid starting a trade war .
it will also demand that Trump display leadership in forging international cooperation , particularly on trade .
and the likelihood that other countries will retaliate makes the situation all the more dangerous .
when a transaction is all &quot; in-@@ house , &quot; it essentially just involves accounting sle@@ ight of hand to book profits in low tax jurisdictions .
Con@@ way is a smart , tough partisan who is expected to be a steady and sensible influence in the campaign .
presumably , he hopes to free Trump to follow his ba@@ sest instincts , spewing vile invective against Clinton as the election contest heats up .
those outside the US want to know the answer , because the outcome affects them , too , though they have no influence over it .
politicians in the US and elsewhere who ignore this lesson will be held accountable .
&quot; aud@@ iting and Reduc@@ ing Fun@@ ding of International Organiz@@ ations , &quot; for example , simply proposes a committee to review financing of multilateral organizations .
careful and deft management by both Republican and Democratic administrations has helped maintain the fragile peace between China and Taiwan .
in particular , the Trump administration takes issue with the Made in China 2025 strategy , introduced by China &apos;s State Council in 2015 with the aim of boosting ten strategic industries , including advanced information technology , automated machine tools and robotics , aviation and spac@@ ef@@ light equipment , and electric vehicles .
on the campaign trail , he promised to undo some key climate policies , even threatening to back out of the Paris climate agreement .
ignoring threats might work in politics , but it does not work in security .
nonetheless , when Trump supporters attacked Republicans who had broken with him , a few re-@@ endorsed him .
to resolve the complex and often controversial issues that arise , broad agreement is needed , and securing it requires clear ground rules .
in any case , on February 9 , he had to reverse his position , losing face just a couple of weeks after his inauguration and setting a bad precedent for future deal-making with the strategically savvy Chinese .
for any of this to work , however , the &quot; big American stick &quot; must be present .
board members and executives must remember that they are also parents , children , partners , and friends .
having already run roughshod over nepotism norms , why not , appoint his wife Vice President , as the presidents of Azerbaijan and Nicaragua have done .
the potential upside to the tremendous uncertainty that many around the world feel is that we essentially are confronted with a clean slate .
but , while the Republicans would need to gain control over at least three or four more legislatures to make a credible attempt , the possibility that they could pursue such a strategy should worry people more than it does .
barring an amendment , the US is protected from some of Trump &apos;s most egregious campaign promises .
at the time , many economists feared that a rapidly expanding money supply and sharply rising government debt would fuel inflation and weaken the dollar .
markets will give Trump the benefit of the doubt , for now ; but investors are now watching whom he appoints to his administration , what shape his fiscal policies actually take , and what course he charts for monetary policy .
here in California , some are hyster@@ ically calling for the entire state to become an immigration sanctuary ; there is even talk of secession .
he also criticized NATO for being unprepared to join the US-led fight against the Islamic State ( ISIS ) .
the second root cause of the euro &apos;s undervaluation lies within the country over which President Trump presides .
within three years , US imports plummeted by 66 % , while exports plunged as well , by 61 % .
this could well constitute a violation of the US Constitution &apos;s em@@ ol@@ uments clause , which forbids a president from accepting gifts from foreign countries .
Trump has claimed that he will disentangle himself from his business to avoid conflicts of interests , while offering no credible plan for doing so .
when sailors cannot rely on maps or charts , they must navigate by sight , and that is precisely our situation today .
serious independent analysis , for example by the World Bank or the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development , finds that the US does not have a high regulatory burden on the non-financial sector .
rather than making Kim back down , Trump &apos;s threats of &quot; fire and fury &quot; have further convinced the North Korean leader that his survival and that of the Kim dynasty depend on nuclear weapons .
understandably , Trump &apos;s declaration has been met with rage from Palestinians , with President Mahmoud Abbas asserting that &quot; from now on &quot; he would not accept &quot; any role &quot; for the US in the peace process , and even calling for the world to reconsider its recognition of Israel .
but on the question of whether North Korea will return to the status of a non-nuclear state and rejoin the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty , Kim will dem@@ ur .
finally , Trump may pursue dam@@ age-@@ control methods that only make matters worse .
but there is more to do .
another approach to determining Trump &apos;s mental fitness would be to have psychiatrists examine him and share their findings .
leveling the playing field in this area means requiring foreign banks also to hold more capital , which is precisely the point of the Basel process .
but that hardly matters if political decisions to deploy forces or launch operations are not taken in time .
after all , Kim &apos;s father and grandfather wrote the script decades ago .
it was a partial deal , to be sure .
in fact , it is partly because of that aid that Afghanistan is a failing state , leaving the US mired in the longest war in its history .
but while US tariffs and non-tariff trade barriers may dent China &apos;s growth in the short term , they will not decisively change its long-term upward trajectory .
finally , the structure of the political system worked against a maverick like Powell .
stop the world , we want to get off .
what happens , for example , when Trump &apos;s words contradict those of one of the &quot; adults &quot; in his Cabinet ?
either way , Trump has eroded the credibility of institutions such as the press , the intelligence agencies , and the US Department of Justice , making everything relative and playing to his extremely loyal base .
I have often heard business leaders complain that competi@@ tive-@@ bidding laws prevent them from just &quot; making a deal &quot; with development agencies .
one could think of this entity in terms of con@@ centric circles , with free movement character@@ izing the inner circle of the EU and constraints allowed in the outer circle .
for starters , with the EU debating countermeasures to US tariffs of 10 % on aluminum and 25 % on steel , it is worth looking beyond the economic significance of the dispute , to the ecological aspects of the commodities in question .
steel comprises a relatively homogeneous class of goods .
the limits of free speech are not just legal .
the system of agricultural protectionism that this compromise produced survives to this day , exemplified in import duties of 69 % on beef and 26 % for pork .
the Department of Commerce itself surely recognizes that more Americans benefit from lower steel and aluminum prices than from higher prices .
he imposed 100 % tariffs on selected Japanese electronics products when Japan allegedly failed to keep exported micro@@ chip prices high .
as a result , the forces of nationalism and nativism are probably more powerful than at any time since the end of World War II .
China is the economic heart of Southeast Asia , accounting for 21 % of the region &apos;s exports in 2015 .
under more extreme circumstances , it could even sequester China &apos;s dollar-denominated foreign assets .
with Trump , those good times may be about to come to an end .
this is not an uncommon tactic for candidates at either end of the political spectrum .
this , together with the Federal Reserve &apos;s gradual interest-rate hikes , will strengthen the dollar , weaken so-called emerging-market currencies , and shift money from the rest of the world to the US .
but Trump certainly could issue a declaration of withdrawal , and then litig@@ ate his authority to implement it .
although Trump &apos;s evidence has not been revealed , I think it is more likely than not that there was a sarin gas attack and that it was ordered by the Assad regime .
in other words , foreign policy requires strategic thinking .
coming from Stalin &apos;s lips , the phrase , backed by the full and fearsome force of the Soviet state &apos;s internal security apparatus , was a death sentence for millions .
but whenever there &apos;s a snat@@ ch of talk or tweet
some observers have criticized former US President Barack Obama for being too soft on the issue , because he allowed China to assert its claims unchecked over the past eight years .
uranium enrichment is certainly the first condition for making bombs , but the level of enrichment must reach about 95 % , compared to 3.5 % for energy production .
Trump &apos;s surrog@@ ates , for their part , use television appearances and social media to re@@ state the falsehoods , seemingly operating under the principle that if you repeat something often enough , it will become true .
&quot; TB treatment is low cost and highly effective , and on average may give an individual in the middle of their productive life around 20 additional years of life , &quot; she concludes .
though the Trump administration is right to have confronted Turkey , it chose not only the wrong response , but also the wrong issue .
the same failed coup that Erdoğan cites as grounds to imprison Brun@@ son has also served as an excuse for de@@ taining thousands of others .
despite his escalating rhetoric , Erdoğan may soon find that he has little choice but to abandon his isolationist and antagonistic policies of the last few years .
thus , despite Gülen &apos;s own embarrassing history of anti-Semitic and anti-Western ser@@ m@@ ons , his followers managed to establish themselves by the 2000s as a civil-society movement that shared Turkish liberals &quot; values and aspirations .
moreover , the Direc@@ tor@@ ate-@@ General of Associ@@ ations has been charged with the task of renov@@ ating houses of worship used by religious minorities , including the historic A@@ ya Nik@@ ola Church in G@@ ö@@ k@@ ç@@ e@@ ada Ç@@ an@@ ak@@ k@@ ale , and the As@@ sy@@ rian Catholic Church and Greek Catholic Church in Is@@ k@@ end@@ er@@ un .
following the AKP &apos;s victory in July , Erdoğan initially sought to avoid antagonizing the military by not renewing Gül &apos;s presidential candidacy .
yet Gül insisted , and the AKP united behind him .
but , this would be to the detriment of Syria &apos;s great diversity .
the Lisbon Treaty was a compromise constitutional arrangement that would nevertheless give the EU greater weight and authority precisely for occasions such as the Copenhagen summit , when global issues are addressed .
ultimately the Chinese Internet cat-and-mouse game will be won with innovation , not political pressure .
more broadly , Pope Francis has shown courage and wisdom in embracing a more decentralized church structure , and envi@@ sioning an inclusive church that is a &quot; home for all . &quot;

investors may worry that if one country re-@@ profiles , other countries in its position will re-@@ profile as well .
but now it has to deal with two sources of existential crisis : Greece and Ukraine .
but trusting solely in a diplomatic dialogue and sanctions to bring about a lasting peace may be excessively optimistic .
Georgia has largely been a side show .
other middle-income countries have discussed adopting similar policies .
so she is attempting to &quot; boil the frog slowly , &quot; ensuring that it doesn &apos;t realize it is being cooked until it is too late to jump out of the pot .
when the Supreme Court ruled that parliament would get a vote , May &apos;s government had to find a third way .
China &apos;s leaders seem intent on proving the old adage that &quot; possession is nine-@@ tenths of the law . &quot;
none of these dire predictions has been borne out by events .
however , the 194@@ 3 Cairo Declaration , which stipulated the Allied Pow@@ ers &quot; basic position on Japan &apos;s territorial boundaries after WWII , stated that Japan would be expelled from all territories that it had annexed through violence .
to see why , we need to understand why banks are still so reluctant .
in low-income countries , a mere 9 % of refugee children are enrolled in secondary school .
young refugees have no time to lose .
it can engage in diplomacy to resolve conflicts and end hostilities , and it can opt for enforcement measures .
there are other corrections as well , like interest and dividends paid and earned , as well as labor remittances .
a similar system has been used successfully in other countries , such as New Zealand , and allows patients and their families to build long-term relationships with providers .
Hu &apos;s unbridled glori@@ fication of &quot; Mao Zedong Thought , &quot; coupled with his suppression of dissent in the media , has begun not only to reveal a true authoritarian , but also to beli@@ e the wishful thinking of liberals , both inside and outside China , who hoped that Hu would be a reform-minded leader .
not only was the story the same , but it even took shortcuts , such as having characters eat on@@ ig@@ iri rice balls , a Japanese food not eaten in China .
to kick-start that process , we have joined the Ocean Un@@ ite network , which is galvan@@ izing conserv@@ ationists , business leaders , young people , and activists to take advantage of growing interest in these issues and create coalitions that can drive ocean health to the top of political and economic agendas worldwide .
the ocean is also the world &apos;s biggest employer , directly supporting the livelihoods of more than three billion people , and is a source of food for over 2.6 billion .
all of this represented an important step forward .
more crises have been erup@@ ting in more places , more breaches of international humanitarian and human rights law have been occurring , and more people have been displaced by conflict than has been the case for decades .
the US does not seek to create an empire in the old sense : America pursues an imperialism of the values that it holds dear .
on March 15 , the UN committee declared that Tanzania had violated its international human-rights obligations .
Tanzania and countries in similar situations must demonstrate their commitment to women &apos;s rights by eliminating systematic discrimination .
in this context , no one country can address key challenges such as climate change , rising inequality , and disruptive technology in isolation from others .
with control of the global reserve currency , the US has room to borrow ; nonetheless , it should structure its borrowing wisely .
indeed , this pattern recur@@ s in the accounts of anyone who has lived in Afghanistan , spoken the language , and understood the workings of patronage and power there .
such messages must be issued more often by the president himself , and not only by officials several bureaucratic layers below .
so , on one side of the divide we have the major health insurers , which all maintain well-funded , national lobbying operations .
all of this is true , but there are a few important caveats .
the gap with 1.6 % average annual growth rate for per capita GDP is small , isn &apos;t it ?
Trump &apos;s media hand@@ lers may be hoping that they can demand compliance as a condition for renewing access .
Hitler , she noted sar@@ cas@@ tically , had solved Germany &apos;s problem by &quot; painting the Black Forest white and putting down lin@@ o@@ leum in the Polish Cor@@ ridor . &quot;
government policy should thus be subject to a longer-term test : how effectively is initiative being enabled and skills developed ?
America &apos;s media and political jun@@ kies are consumed by the various possibilities .
the Democrats favor loose monetary policy , low interest rates , and a depreciated dollar .
no one knows right now whether Trump will fl@@ ame out or prove to have staying power , but one thing is clear : he is not the only one injecting stran@@ gen@@ ess into the nomination contest .
a third issue is climate change .
the attractiveness of these assets , and of the American lifestyle that they represent , is that they enable the US to persuade , rather than compel , others to adopt its agenda .
the US had done pretty well on all of these fronts .
downturns are a normal feature of the US economy , which has experienced nine recessions during the last 50 years .
even when Obama was actively supporting Russia &apos;s accession to the World Trade Organization earlier in his presidency , he had to exp@@ end considerable political capital just to repeal the 1974 Jack@@ son-@@ V@@ ani@@ k Amendment , which secured freer Jewish emigration from the Soviet Union as a condition for normal trade relations .
yet , again , this does not mean that a bear market isn &apos;t approaching .
the new tax law might also follow the Canadian example and eliminate the estate tax , while imposing a tax on capital gains accrued before the taxpayer &apos;s death .
but , regardless of whether the tax bill survives the reconciliation process and becomes law , the big news won &apos;t change : the Anglo-Saxon model of representative government is in serious trouble .
they regard a request for back@@ doors the same way an automobile manufacturer would view a request for a defective engine .
it is powerful ammunition in a potential trade war .
this is the main reason why the US security state refuses to tell the truth .

asked whether &quot; social liberalism &quot; is a &quot; force for good &quot; or a &quot; force for ill , &quot; 87 % of &quot; Remain &quot; voters said it was a force for good , while 53 % of Leave voters called liberalism a &quot; force for ill . &quot;
the idea certainly sounds appealing .

but the acknowledged responsibility of states in implementing the right to water cannot turn them into the sole paying authority .
these uncertainties , indeed , led the Forum to avoid acknowledging a formal right to water in its final resolution .
such a move would hurt the developing world , especially the Asia-Pacific region , including Australia .

indeed , few governments have submitted remotely realistic budget projections , typically relying on overly rosy economic scenarios .
the Irish government that encouraged reckless bank lending and the creation of a property bubble was , perhaps not surprisingly , no more adept in managing the economy after the crisis that it was before .

when looking at actual economic policies as they have evolved over decades , we see that they always combine center-right and center-left elements .
other venues , perhaps new institutions , are needed to fill that space .
